<blockquote>
<p>But it was still deeply upsetting. My eyes started to water just writing about it. The good death of a beloved animal who has led a good life is both sad and OK. The inescapability of mortality means we have to accept it but we don’t have to feel good about it.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Reading this brought back memories of our prior black lab, Ceiligh, and our decision to euthanize her once she was diagnosed with significant and incurable cancer.</p>
<p>In addition to everything described in this essay, two other factors made this a very difficult decision:</p>
<ol>
<li>We made the choice on her behalf. Of course, we made the choice to reduce her suffering, but it was still an active choice for which we were accountable.</li>
<li>Our kids were young enough to not have experienced much loss yet, while also old enough to understand what was happening. Explaining to them why this was the best outcome was difficult.</li>
</ol>
<p>We valued Ceiligh&rsquo;s role in our family and welcomed her predecesor, Lucy, knowing that the choice might arise again, while also knowing how much she would enrich our lives.</p>

			 <p>Finished reading: <a href="https://micro.blog/books/9780593186596">The Biggest Ideas in the Universe</a> by Sean Carroll.  I really appreciated this book. Starting from high school math, Carroll leads you through 200 crisp and entertaining pages to actually show you how to derive Einstein&rsquo;s Theory of General Relativity. A nice middle ground between the analogies of popular science books and the intense detail of a text book. I&rsquo;m looking forward to the next book in the series. 📚</p>

			 <p>🏊‍♂️🚴‍♂️🏃‍♂️ I&rsquo;ve cancelled <a href="https://www.strava.com/athletes/3802125">my Strava</a> subscription. This isn&rsquo;t directly caused by the price increase (though a 100% increase is big!), rather this was a good reason to reconsider the service. Most of the <a href="https://www.strava.com/subscribe">Strava features</a> that I&rsquo;ve found useful (detailed analytics for the most part) I can also get from the built-in Apple Fitness metrics, augmented by the <a href="https://apps.apple.com/app/id1202650514">HealthFit app</a>. So, I&rsquo;m not seeing the value in keeping the subscription. I&rsquo;ll keep using the app, though, since I do appreciate the social aspects of the service.</p>

			 <p>Articles like &ldquo;<a href="https://aeon.co/essays/we-will-never-be-able-to-live-on-another-planet-heres-why">We will never be able to live on another planet. Here’s why</a>&rdquo; highlight an important tension. As a fan of science fiction, I&rsquo;m really excited by the prospect of space exploration and agree that, eventually, we need to find additional places to live and thrive.</p>
<p>But:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Astronomical observations and Earth’s geological record are clear: the only planet that can support us is the one we evolved with. There is no plan B. There is no planet B. Our future is here, and it doesn’t have to mean we’re doomed.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And, so, we need to take much better care of our planet. There&rsquo;s lots of excitement here too: clean energy, resilient infrastructure, better agriculture. Along with some real existential dread and disapointment with our behaviour so far.</p>
<p>I like to think we can do both of these things: explore beyond our planet, while taking good care of what we have. Sometimes the balance seems off though.</p>

			 <p>I read many more books this year than in recent, past years. Although this was intentional, I’m glad it worked out. I really cut back on my various internet feeds, so that I was less distracted away from books. <a href="https://matt.routleynet.org/2022/07/24/my-annual-cottage.html">Purchasing a Kobo</a> and connecting it to the local public library was also helpful.</p>
<p>The most influential non-fiction book for me this year was <a href="https://micro.blog/books/9780374159122">Four Thousand Weeks</a> by Oliver Burkeman. Plenty of practical and insightful advice in this book.</p>
<p>Picking a favourite fiction book is always fraught. This year, I think it was <a href="https://micro.blog/books/9781473621459">A Closed and Common Orbit</a> by Becky Chambers. Something about the emotional core of this book really resonated with me.</p>
<p>Here’s the full list of books from the year:</p>

			 <p>I&rsquo;ve been interested for a while now in better understanding the underlying mechanics of computers. I&rsquo;ve also been keen to do something other than stare at a screen. <a href="https://upperstory.com/turingtumble/">Turing Tumble</a> is a fun solution to both of these goals.</p>
<p>Turing Tumble is an educational game in which you build a mechanical computer that is powered by marbles. The game comes with a comic book that guides you through ever more complex computing principles, adding more sophisticated parts as you progress. Each principle is presented as a challenge in which you&rsquo;re given a goal and a few starting pieces. You then have to integrate some earlier principles into the new goal to come up with a solution. The challenges get pretty tough! But, I&rsquo;m enjoying figuring out each puzzle while making progress through the story.</p>
<p>Just as an example, here&rsquo;s Challenge 26 in which the goal is to release 4 blue marbles, 1 red, and then another 4 blue. The blue, arrow-shaped pieces are bits that allow you to count, while the black piece near the top right corner is an interceptor for stopping computation (warning, spoilers ahead!).</p>

			 <p>Other than knowing if I was physically capable of finishing, the main source of uncertainty when I signed up for <a href="https://matt.routleynet.org/2021/12/14/after-likely-too.html">my first triathlon</a> was how much it would cost. Starting out, I had one pair of running shoes and some goggles from my kids' swimming lessons. So, I knew I&rsquo;d need to invest in a lot of gear.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s the list of what I ended up buying along with some commentary. Of course it is important to note that these costs can vary widely, based on what you may already have and the budget you&rsquo;re willing to spend. For several of these items, there&rsquo;s a very wide range of costs from barely good enough to really fancy. I tended towards the medium-low end of the distribution: enough to get good, reliable equipment, but far away from top end. I figured I should at least finish one triathlon before investing too much money in equipment.</p>
<p>All amounts are in Canadian dollars and rounded to something reasonable.</p>
<h2 id="swimming">Swimming</h2>
<ul>
<li>Wetsuit: $400 for the <a href="https://www.endurosport.com/triathlon/nineteen-pipeline-full-sleeve-wetsuit-men/">Nineteen Pipeline</a> a decent entry level model</li>
<li>Swim equipment: $200 for a bathing suit, flutter board, goggles, swim cap, and other gear</li>
<li><a href="https://www.endurosport.com/swim/accessories/open-water-gear-swim-buddy-touring/">Swim buddy</a>: $70 and important if doing any open water swimming. Provides visibility for boaters, something to hold onto if you need a rest, and some storage space</li>
<li>Swimming fees: $100 for access to a local municipal pool for a few months. A common alternative is to join a swim club, which would be more expensive, but would also include coaching and community support</li>
</ul>
<p>Total: $800</p>
<h2 id="biking">Biking</h2>
<ul>
<li>Before investing in a bike, I invested $200 in a <a href="https://matt.routleynet.org/2022/01/15/bike-sizing.html">bike sizing session</a>. No point in buying a bike that didn&rsquo;t fit!</li>
<li>Bike: Of all the items in the budget, this is both the most expensive and the most variable. You can spend <a href="https://www.cervelo.com/en-CA/bikes/p5">$15,000 on a fancy bike</a> or get by with a used one in the few hundred dollar range. <a href="https://matt.routleynet.org/2022/01/22/new-bike.html">This Trek for $2,500</a> both fit my needs and was actually available (COVID-induced shortages wreaked havoc on bike supply chains)</li>
<li>Turns out that fancy bikes don&rsquo;t come with pedals, so another $200 for those and $300 for shoes</li>
<li>Also, based on the bike fit, I swapped out the handlebars with another set for $200, plus aero bars for $300</li>
<li>Another $500 for clothes, water bottles, bottle cages, and a repair kit</li>
<li>Given I started training in the winter, I <a href="https://matt.routleynet.org/2022/02/21/indoor-cycling.html">added an indoor trainer</a> for $1,000</li>
<li>Bike computer: $400 for the <a href="https://www.garmin.com/en-US/p/596828">Garmin Edge 130</a>. Since I was already tracking metrics via my Apple Watch and iPhone, I kept this one simple, mostly just to have easily visible metrics during <a href="https://matt.routleynet.org/2022/09/03/an-early-start.html">long rides on the weekend</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Total: $5,600 (yikes)</p>
<h2 id="running">Running</h2>
<ul>
<li>This one is pretty easy, two sets of running shoes at about $200 each</li>
</ul>
<p>Total: $400</p>
<h2 id="other">Other</h2>
<p>Some odds and ends:</p>
<ul>
<li>Trisuit: $200</li>
<li>Registration fee for the event: $500</li>
<li><a href="https://www.tremblant.ca">Accommodations</a> for three days: $1,000. This one is obviously pretty variable, based on the event location</li>
<li>A <a href="https://matt.routleynet.org/2021/12/23/finding-a-triathlon.html">coach</a> for 6 months at $280/month and worth every penny</li>
</ul>
<p>Total: $3,400</p>
<hr>
<p>In the end, about $10,000! Seems like a lot (and it is), though it was spread out over 8 months. Plus, this was essentially my only hobby and leisure activity for that time. Nonetheless, I&rsquo;m grateful to my family for putting up with this.</p>

			 <p>My annual cottage vacation is imminent and a favourite part is reading books by the lake.</p>
<p>In past years, I&rsquo;ve packed a pile of library books. But, I average more than ten books over the break. Adding in my family (though they&rsquo;re less voracious readers) means we end up with a big box of books to fit in an already crowded car.</p>
<p>So, the past few years I’ve switched to reading library books on my iPad. Being able to “carry” so many books on the device, plus adding more if necessary, is great. The downsides, though, include difficulty reading through the glare of sunlight and the occasional shutdown from overheating. Plus, there are so many easy distractions on an iPad.</p>
<p>Thanks to a good discount and a review by Jason Snell of <a href="https://sixcolors.com/post/2021/12/how-kobo-beats-kindle-on-library-books/">integrating with public libraries</a>, I’ve bought a <a href="https://ca.kobobooks.com/products/kobo-libra-2">Kobo Libra 2</a>. This is now my dedicated library book device (although it does have other features, like a bookstore, Pocket integration, and audiobooks). The e-ink really is remarkably easy to read outside, even in direct sunlight, and I like the physical page-turn buttons.</p>
<p>Although I always have a general preference for physical books, the convenience of an entire public library on a handheld device can&rsquo;t be beat for vacation reading.</p>

			 <p>After a few days of recovery, and before I forget, here are a few notes on the <a href="https://matt.routleynet.org/2022/06/27/the-ironman-in.html">Tremblant 70.3 Ironman</a>.</p>
<p>The short version (given there&rsquo;s lots of details below) is that the course was fantastic and the race was really well organized.</p>
<h2 id="pre-race">Pre-race</h2>
<p>This part was easy and the day prior to the race. There were scheduled times for registration and all we needed was the QR code from our online payment. With that, they handed over a wristband, timing chip, all sorts of stickers with my bib number, swim cap, t-shirt, and a morning gear bag for transferring clothing from the swim start to the run finish.</p>
<p>Next up was dropping my bike off at the transition. There were two stickers for the bike, both of which had my bib number on them and matched the number on my wristband. Staff at the transition entrance used these to make sure the bike belonged to me, before letting me in. Then I tracked down my transition spot, which was at the bike start end of the transition zone.</p>
<p>They also had a mandatory athlete&rsquo;s briefing in the afternoon. As a first timer, this was really helpful. They talked through the overall course, showed some specific turn arounds and tricky spots, and then reminded us of the important rules. There were also repeated (and welcome) warnings that race day was going to be exceedingly hot (at least for recently hibernating Canadians) and that everyone needed to take precautions.</p>
<p>That was it for the Saturday events, other than finding some food and trying to get a good night&rsquo;s sleep. Sunday (race day) started early, so that I could get the rest of my transition spot set up by 6:30. As with the bike, they checked wristbands before letting anyone in. I took about 10 minutes to get everything organized and visualize how I&rsquo;d move through the zone.</p>
<h2 id="swim">Swim</h2>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Although the novelty might wear off after a few more races, standing on a beach with 2,000 other people along with a strong mix of excitement and anxiety is quite the experience. People were in and out of the lake to get in a warmup swim before the start and then the national anthem played just before 7. The pro men started right at 7, followed by the pro women at 7:05, and then the rest of us started at 7:10. We were all self organized into corrals of different expected finish times and I aimed for the back end of the 34-37 minute corral.</p>
<p>Rather than one big mass start, there was a gate system at the start of the swim that let six swimmers through every 10 seconds. This kept a steady stream of swimmers going through the start without a giant crowd. The only downside was that it took a while to clear the beach. The pro men had already started their bike rides before I&rsquo;d even left the beach! I crossed the start line at 7:32.</p>
<p>Not much to say about the swim. The water was a nice, cool temperature and there were only a few spots around the half-way point where there was any significant contact with other swimmers. This was mostly because at that point we were swimming directly into the sun and seeing the buoys was really challenging. We all just kept swimming forward, assuming that anyone in front of us was headed in roughly the right direction and it all worked out.</p>
<p>I saw at least three people getting hauled out of the water by the safety teams that were paddling around in canoes and kayaks. I can only imagine how difficult it would be to need to quit the race so early, but safety is so much more important than pushing through and risking serious injury.</p>
<p>One challenge I had with the <a href="https://matt.routleynet.org/2022/06/05/a-big-thank.html">Milton sprint triathlon</a> was significant dizziness at the end of the swim and, consequently, a challenge getting through T1 on the bike. So, this time I slowed down near the end of the swim and tried to more carefully move from vertical to horizontal while getting out of the water. This seemed to help; although I still felt a bit light-headed, it wasn&rsquo;t nearly as bad as last time.</p>
<p>33 minutes for the swim was faster than I&rsquo;d planned, though I felt good throughout. So, I wasn&rsquo;t worried.</p>
<p>The swim ended with a 200m run into the transition zone. During this, I was able to wiggle out of the top half of my wetsuit, in preparation for the rest of the transition. Once I was at my transition spot, I pulled off the wetsuit and quickly consumed one <a href="https://endurancetap.com/products/caffeinated-energy-gel-can">caffeinated gel</a>. Then helmet on (they&rsquo;re really strict about not touching your bike without a helmet on), bike shoes on, and grabbed the bike to run out to the bike mount line.</p>
<h2 id="bike">Bike</h2>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>The bike course was gorgeous. Lots of hills through Canadian Shield and forests on (mostly) smooth asphalt. There was a really steep downhill around km 16 that got me up to about 79 km/h and, since this was part of a loop, I also had to climb back up this hill on the way back. I&rsquo;d been worried about this when looking at the map. But, in the end, it wasn&rsquo;t so bad. I knew it was coming and just had to power through. The part that surprised me was the undulating hills in the last third. Despite the great scenery, these were really hard!</p>
<p>My coach had advised I keep my heart rate around 155 throughout the bike course. Other than a few of the climbs, I was able to stick to this. It was actually really helpful to have a specific target to keep trying to hit. Three hours on the bike can get rather tedious without something to focus on and there&rsquo;s always a worry about pushing too hard on the bike and blowing up on the run.</p>
<p>There were four aid stations on the bike course. Given the heat warning, at each one I grabbed a 750mL bottle of water. 2/3rds of the water I sprayed onto my head for cooling, the rest I drank. They had kids at the end of each aid station with hockey nets and sticks. You threw the empty bottle towards the net and they stick handled them in for disposal.</p>
<p>I also had a 750mL bottle of electrolytes and 500mL bottle of water on the bike that I consumed throughout, along with two <a href="https://endurancetap.com/products/stroopwafel?ref=yotpo_94">Stroopwafels</a> and two <a href="https://endurancetap.com/products/classic-energy-gel-can?ref=yotpo_94">energy gels</a>.</p>
<p>2 hours and 56 minutes on the bike was a few minutes faster than I&rsquo;d anticipated. So, also happy with this. By the end of the 90km, my legs felt reasonably fresh, but I was glad to get off the bike. Things were starting to get pretty uncomfortable. This might partly have been because it was actually my first ever ride with aero bars. I wouldn&rsquo;t recommend waiting until a race to try these out, though that was how it worked out for me. Overall, I&rsquo;d say the aero bars were more comfortable than I&rsquo;d expected, I just wasn&rsquo;t used to them.</p>
<h2 id="run">Run</h2>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>T2 was straightforward. I racked my bike, took off my helmet, and switched to running shoes and a hat. One more caffeinated gel and off I went.</p>
<p>My plan was to maintain a 5:30 minutes/km pace for the run with an emphasis on keeping it slow after the bike transition (it is really tempting to start running fast off the bike). This was sustainable for about the first half. By the second half, though, the heat really started catching up with me and I had to slow down to around 6 minutes/km. I was super sensitive about pushing too hard in the heat and, consequently, jeopardizing actually finishing the race. So, I wasn&rsquo;t upset about slowing down. I did see at least two people off to the side of the course being attended by medics with apparent heat stroke, which were good reminders to pace carefully.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d committed to myself before the race that I would walk through each of the 12 aid stations. At each one, one water went onto my head, another I drank, and then I grabbed a couple of cups of ice. I had a small ziplock bag that I put ice in to hold, while the other ice went down the front of the Triathlon suit. Like me, many of the runners were making lots of jiggling noises as the ice that had fallen down into our shorts bounced around. Absolutely necessary though, given the heat and humidity.</p>
<p>For nutrition on the run, I had two gels: one at about the 10km mark and the other around 15 km.</p>
<p>The run course was also gorgeous. We ran through a decommissioned rail road track converted to a multi-use recreational path through the heart of the Laurentians that included waterfalls and forested areas. Although not as shaded as I&rsquo;d hoped, the course was great. There were also a few spots with sprinklers or fire hydrants spraying water. These were helpful for cooling down. I was particularly amused by the local resident that was lounging in a lawn chair with a beer in one hand and hose in the other. A bit of eye contact and thumbs up was all you needed to have him hose you down on the way by: so refreshing!</p>
<p>Kilometres 14 to 17 were pretty tough. I was far enough along to be pretty tired, but not yet quite far enough to know that it was almost over. Knowing my family was at the end, ready to cheer me on really helped here.</p>
<p>The last km of the run was an extra experience. You run right down the hill through the middle of the Tremblant village with spectators cheering you on from either side. Despite all the hard work up to this point, you really feel pretty energized for this part, especially when you finally see the finish line up ahead.</p>
<p>2 hours and 3 minutes for the run was just a few minutes slower than I&rsquo;d anticipated. I was totally happy with this time, given everything that preceded it and the heat.</p>
<h2 id="post-race">Post-race</h2>
<p>The finish line funnels you into a big tent with picnic benches. There were plenty of cold drinks available, along with a plate filled with pasta and french fries. I grabbed a couple of waters and then made my way out of the tent to see my family. I was pretty focused on that point with seeing them and then getting into the lake to cool down.</p>
<p>My main goal had been to finish the race. That was accomplished. My second goal was to be in the top half of finishers. I managed to be in the top 1/3 for my age group and top 1/2 overall. So, I was very happy with my overall results.</p>
<p>I felt that I executed the race well. No issues with hydration or nutrition, along with an intentionally conservative level of effort to maximize my chances of finishing the race worked out well.</p>
<p>Two minor lessons learned: more sunscreen, I burned the back of my shoulders pretty thoroughly; and some more lubrication under the zipper of the Triathlon suit, I still have a pretty good friction burn in the middle of my chest.</p>

<p>A huge thanks to my fantastic race crew! Their support and enthusiasm were great, not to mention all their help over the past several months of training. Knowing they&rsquo;d be at the finish line really got me through the tough kilometres 14 to 17 on the run.</p>

			 <p>With two school-age kids, this seemed inevitable:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>All things considered, my symptoms aren&rsquo;t too bad, which I&rsquo;m grateful for. Nonetheless, I&rsquo;ve mostly been in bed for a couple of days to properly recover.</p>
<p>Since I&rsquo;ve been monitoring my <a href="https://matt.routleynet.org/2021/08/08/readiness-to-train.html">Readiness To Train (RTT) score</a>, I was curious to see how COVID would appear in the metrics.</p>
<p>Thursday morning was the first indication that something was wrong. I completed what felt like a reasonably strong swim workout, only to suddenly feel really drained of energy while walking home from the pool.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>After dragging myself home, we found out my son&rsquo;s friend had tested positive. So, both he and I took a rapid test that confirmed we were infected.</p>
<p>Thursday night was peak symptoms for me, producing an abysmal RTT.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>All morning in bed on Friday helped a lot and then a much better sleep last night layered improvement on top.</p>
<p>Today&rsquo;s RTT seems rather optimistic to me though. My planned intensity included a two hour bike ride and 20k run. Those are not happening! Today&rsquo;s planned intensity will be watching the season finale of Severance in my pyjamas.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>My experience with RTT is that it typically reinforces how I actually feel with, perhaps, the occasional early warning. Basically a second opinion that reinforces my intuition. But when we disagree, like now, I&rsquo;m definitely following how I feel.</p>

			 <p>I added a new pair of running shoes to my closet: <a href="https://www.saucony.com/on/demandware.store/Sites-saucony_us-Site/default/Product-Show?pid=44595M">Saucony Switchback 2</a>. They are a lightweight trail shoe with the BOA Fit System (rather than laces) and good treads for gripping.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>I took them out for a <a href="https://www.strava.com/activities/6903904651">10k run around the neighbourhood</a>. Not quite the right conditions, since I was mostly on sidewalks and they&rsquo;re trail running shoes. Despite that, the shoes felt fast and light. For the first couple of kms, I felt a bit like I was slapping my feet on the ground, since I&rsquo;m used to <a href="https://matt.routleynet.org/2021/12/21/after-years-of.html">more cushioning</a> and my feet weren&rsquo;t making contact quite when I was expecting them to. I didn&rsquo;t take long to adjust to a better form though. I&rsquo;m curious to see what the transition back to my usual shoes is like. Presumably with practice, I&rsquo;ll be able to switch back and forth easily.</p>
<p>Overall, I&rsquo;m happy with the new shoes and look forward to getting out to an actual trail with them.</p>

			 <p>Just fixed a small issue with my <a href="https://matt.routleynet.org/2022/02/21/indoor-cycling.html">Elite Suito bike trainer</a>: the magnets stopped working, so the resistance couldn&rsquo;t be automatically adjusted. This is obviously a major feature of the trainer and particularly important for <a href="https://www.zwift.com/">Zwift rides</a>.</p>
<p>Fortunately, a quick conversation with their support team identified a fix that required <a href="https://elitesrl.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360017127959-How-to-replace-the-electronic-circuit-board#h_01EN30S24JZXAVC235EZMZN9PK">replacing the trainer&rsquo;s circuit board</a>. Having <a href="https://matt.routleynet.org/2021/01/10/transforming-boxes-of.html">recently built a gaming PC with my son</a>, this wasn&rsquo;t too complicated, though someone with less experience would likely be intimidated. The process took about 20 minutes and I took the bike for a quick Zwift ride to confirm all was well.</p>

<p>Although I&rsquo;d much have preferred that the trainer hadn&rsquo;t broken, Elite support was quick and helpful.</p>

			 <p>I&rsquo;m still <a href="https://matt.routleynet.org/2019/10/15/task-management-with.html">using MindNode for task management</a>. Seeing all of my tasks, projects, and areas of focus on one mind map has been really helpful, especially since it is integrated with Reminders.</p>
<p>One challenge has been integration with Mail, given the majority of my tasks arrive via email. Despite Apple&rsquo;s seemingly inexplicable decision to isolate Mail from the usual sharing actions found in other apps, they at least allow drag and drop from Mail into Reminders, which adds a link to the original email message. This works with MindNode too. If you drag an email onto a node, it will add a link there. The issue is that when you synchronize MindNode with Reminders, the links to emails from MindNode no longer work when shown in Reminders.</p>
<p>After tinkering around for a bit, there&rsquo;s a relatively easy fix. When you drag a mail message to a node in MindNode, it adds a url that looks something like:</p>
<pre><code>message:%3CYT2PR01MB9@YT2PR01MB9447.CANPRD01%3E
</code></pre>
<p>Editing the link to add <code>//</code> after <code>message:</code>makes the link work in Reminders, while also continuing to work in MindNode.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not sure why MindNode creates a url that isn&rsquo;t accessible from other apps (perhaps a security feature?). At least this fix, though a bit annoying, allows for a more seamless integration between Mail, MindNode, and Reminders.</p>

			 <p>The last piece of my training setup was an indoor bike trainer. Canadian winters aren&rsquo;t great for outdoor cycling (-20ºC with a blizzard just a few days ago, for example). So, I picked up an <a href="https://www.elite-it.com/en/products/home-trainers/interactive-trainers/suito-t">Elite Suito-t</a> which is well reviewed and on sale at my local bike shop. This is a direct transmission model with built in power and cadence sensors.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t have enough space in my house for a spot fully dedicated to cycling. So, I&rsquo;ve got the bike a trainer tucked in a corner of the basement and then I slide our basement couch out of the way and move the bike in front of the TV when I&rsquo;m riding. The compact size of the Suito definitely helps here.</p>
<p><img src="https://matt.routleynet.org/uploads/2022/5e18fbcf97.jpg" alt="Indoor bike trainer setup"></p>
<p>The Suito came with a free month of <a href="https://www.zwift.com/">Zwift</a> that I&rsquo;ve really been enjoying. Zwift has lots of group rides and workouts that are fun (though hard work!). Because the Suito is a smart trainer, it automatically adjusts resistance to mimic hills, as well as hit specific targets during structured workouts. Riding with a hundred or so people from around the world is inspiring and motivating.</p>
<p>Although I&rsquo;m really looking forward to proper outdoor rides in the spring, this indoor setup has been great.</p>

			 <p>I knew going in that a <a href="https://matt.routleynet.org/2021/12/14/after-likely-too.html">first triathlon</a> requires a lot of planning and gear, especially when you don&rsquo;t have any equipment.</p>
<p>Given that the cycling component is the longest distance, it is important to have a good bike. Once I knew <a href="https://matt.routleynet.org/2022/01/15/bike-sizing.html">my size</a>, the next step was to actually choose a bike. And, oh my, are there decisions to make.</p>
<p>As with most things, budget sets a pretty useful constraint. Within that, there&rsquo;s finding the sweet spot between spending enough to get something good that you won&rsquo;t regret compromising on later and spending so much that you&rsquo;ve exceeded your fitness level and can&rsquo;t capitalize any speed gains from the purchase.</p>
<p>My bike sizing was based on a <a href="https://www.trekbikes.com/ca/en_CA/domane/">Trek Domane</a> and I figured that was a good place to start. The next choice to make was between aluminum and carbon fibre. The obvious difference here is price. <a href="https://youtu.be/h3RG5dztrXM">This Global Cycling Network video</a> helped me understand that an aluminum frame is more than sufficient for me. Spending a <a href="https://www.trekbikes.com/ca/en_CA/bikes/road-bikes/performance-road-bikes/domane/domane-sl/domane-sl-7-etap/p/32996/">few thousand extra dollars</a> to gain a few minutes advantage in a &ldquo;fun&rdquo; race is a bad choice. Consistent training is going to provide a much better advantage than the choice of bike frame.</p>
<p>Having made it this far, I figured it was time to start looking around for options, only to find out that COVID had disrupted yet another supply chain. There are close to zero new or used bikes in the market. In fact, there was exactly <em>one</em> <a href="https://www.trekbikes.com/ca/en_CA/bikes/road-bikes/performance-road-bikes/domane/domane-al/domane-al-4-disc/p/33085/?colorCode=black">Trek Domane AL 4</a> in Toronto with the next nearest one 200 km west in London. The AL 4 seemed like the right balance of cost and performance for me. So, that&rsquo;s now my bike!</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>After all that, I now have the fanciest bike (by far) that I&rsquo;ve ever owned and it is -20ºC outside just after the <a href="https://matt.routleynet.org/2022/01/17/theres-been-some.html">biggest snow storm in decades</a>. Rather than just stare forlornly at the bike for the next few months, my next purchase will be an indoor trainer, so that I can build up cycling fitness while winter carries on.</p>

			 <p>I&rsquo;ll be spending many hours and a reasonable amount of money on a bicycle over the next few months. To be efficient, comfortable, and injury free, I want the bike to fit me closely. So, I sought the advice of <a href="http://fitt1stbikefit.blogspot.com/">Scott</a>, a professional bike fitter.</p>
<p>Scott has an interesting contraption that is the various parts of a bike, each adjustable, with which he can recreate any <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bicycle_frame#Frame_geometry">frame geometry</a>. He started out with a <a href="https://www.trekbikes.com/ca/en_CA/domane/">Trek Domane</a> as a reference point and had me ride it for a few minutes. Then with an assortment of rulers, protractors, and lasers, he measured me, moved parts, measured again, and optimized the fit. Once the fit was established, he generated a detailed report for me of all the various lengths and angles that I can use to confirm the size of any bike that I find.</p>
<p>I also learned that my tibias are longer than my femurs (not by much) which is not typical (most people have longer femurs). This ends up affecting my optimal bike geometry, since it affects the angle of my knee and hip when at the top of a pedal stroke.</p>
<p>Now that I know what size of bike to get, I&rsquo;m on the search. The COVID-induced supply chain challenges are definitely affecting availability.</p>

			 <p>As an experiment, I spent the past week listening only to the <a href="https://www.macstories.net/stories/a-comprehensive-guide-to-250-of-apple-musics-new-mood-and-activity-playlists/">Activity Playlists in Apple Music</a>. So, whatever I was doing, I picked the most closely related playlist.</p>
<p>Often these were straightforward. Cooking dinner with help from the kids: <a href="https://music.apple.com/us/playlist/cooking-with-family/pl.5f59cffdd4644040bed2b7562d83f270">Cooking with Family</a>; triaging the morning inbox of email: <a href="https://music.apple.com/us/playlist/checking-email/pl.f323a401141748cfb74e08ef2f98193f">Checking Email</a>; mind mapping a project: <a href="https://music.apple.com/us/playlist/brainstorming/pl.acf4e6669fbd4baba50e249d57db5a61">Brainstorming</a>.</p>
<p>Other times it was more mood oriented. Reading by the fire when it is -20ºC: <a href="https://music.apple.com/us/playlist/winter/pl.8b36c21d1ce7493392a2f845c4293408">Winter</a>; augmenting an early Wednesday morning coffee: <a href="https://music.apple.com/us/playlist/wake-me-up/pl.c79a0c8eac46444ea8058d68008ba2d4">Wake Me Up!</a>.</p>
<p>Overall, the playlists are good.</p>
<p>The ones I listened to are meaningfully distinct from each other and the song choices do match the general mood of the activity. Just as one example, although their names are quite close, I did get different vibes from the <a href="https://music.apple.com/us/playlist/deep-focus/pl.556863bb540c4651b6196bf82e2a3bb9">Deep Focus</a>, <a href="https://music.apple.com/us/playlist/peaceful-focus/pl.9b8a976ba78741d9925e6e9a050703de">Peaceful Focus</a>, and <a href="https://music.apple.com/us/playlist/creative-focus/pl.4351e59aabd44f73a7b2a832020acc55">Creative Focus</a> playlists.</p>
<p>In general the song choices are, not surprisingly, oriented towards the pop genres. That said, they aren’t just a collection of current hits. Playlists include some old gems and more obscure songs. Clearly, the songs were chosen with care and not strictly driven by machine learning algorithms.</p>
<p>One unanticipated side effect of this was that the rest of the family noted how much better the music was in the kitchen. No more of that “weird Dad music” 🙄. I take some consolation in the knowledge that in about ten years they’ll rediscover and appreciate these “classic songs” and finally realize that, in fact, I do have good musical tastes.</p>
<p>Although the music is generally good, discoverability is terrible. MacStories <a href="https://www.macstories.net/stories/a-comprehensive-guide-to-250-of-apple-musics-new-mood-and-activity-playlists/">pointed this out</a> and created a very helpful Shortcut for grouping and playing these playlists. Even when you select “See All” from the Just Ask Siri section, Apple Music shows some random selection of the playlists. I haven’t noticed any particular pattern of which ones are displayed and can’t understand why Apple is making it so difficult to browse them. Maybe they’re still experimenting?</p>
<p>I never did find reasons to listen to many of the playlists, like the whole series for Zodiac signs or the one for <a href="https://music.apple.com/us/playlist/square-dancing/pl.81be3a937c8f416391f8c13ca38ae5f9">square dancing</a>. This just shows the diversity of playlists available and, again, points out the problem with discoverability.</p>
<p>This was a successful experiment that forced me to actually experience the feature. That said, I wouldn’t want to continue relying on only these playlists. I’ll keep using them when I can’t be bothered to carefully choose an album or playlist and just want something appropriate to the mood or activity, which surely is the whole point of them anyway.</p>

			 <p>I’ve been in a pool with my Apple Watch before, though only either to splash around with the kids or with a beer at an all-inclusive resort. Today was the first time I’ve used it for an actual swimming workout. It has also been a long time since my high school swimming days back in the early 90s. So, an important day!</p>
<p>My coach gave me a straightforward workout:</p>
<ul>
<li>Warm up 2 x 50m and 4 x 25m</li>
<li>Main set 10 x 50m with 20s rest and 10 x 25m with 20s rest</li>
<li>2 x 100m with 1 min rest</li>
</ul>
<p>As expected, using the Apple Watch was simple. When you start up the workout, it asks for the length of the pool and then automatically figures out when you stop for a rest. This shows up in the “Auto Sets” in the screenshot below. Based on this, it looks like my rests were longer than planned, though I’m not entirely sure how precise these are and when it decides to start and stop. Something to keep an eye on next time.</p>
<p><img src="https://matt.routleynet.org/uploads/2022/42fa89b3ac.png" alt="Screenshots from the Apple Fitness app of a swimming workout"></p>
<p>I enjoyed being in the pool again and my muscle memory seemed to return. Way back in high school, I specialized in the 1,500m and was very familiar with the seemingly endless flip turns of a pool swim. One thing I need to work on is breath control. I’ve gotten very used to just breathing whenever I want and had some trouble getting in three strokes before breathing near the end of the workout. No doubt this will improve with practice.</p>
<p>I also need to work on my wardrobe. I was the only one in the pool wearing board shorts and no swim cap 😀</p>

		<a href="https://matt.routleynet.org/2022/01/03/time-to-stop.html" class="u-url"><time class="dt-published" datetime="2022-01-03 15:31:15 -0500">Jan 3, 2022</time></a>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>Through 2020, I built up an ornate system for tracking my time for both work and personal projects (like <a href="https://matt.routleynet.org/2020/07/26/reading-shortcut-for.html">this one for reading</a>). For most of 2021, I found this tracking really helpful.</p>
<p>I need to track my hours at work anyway, so using <a href="https://timeryapp.com">Timery</a> and Shortcuts to automate much of this has been great. Having a strong sense of how long things take and ensuring good balance across projects are all benefits of time tracking.</p>
<p>For personal projects, though, I’ve been starting to feel a bit stressed by having a timer always running whenever I’m doing something, almost like I’m always in a race. At first, knowing how much time I was spending on particular things was great for my <a href="https://matt.routleynet.org/2020/12/28/year-of-the.html">Year of the Tangible intention</a>. This is well established now, and I haven’t been using the time reports for any personal projects. So, why am I creating anxiety for no benefit?</p>
<p>I’ve turned off all of my time tracking automations for personal projects. Despite some <a href="https://matt.routleynet.org/2021/12/14/i-really-like.html">annoying bugs</a>, ScreenTime is a good-enough replacement for keeping an eye on time spent on things like YouTube and social networking. A nice side benefit is that this also reduces the number of Shortcuts and other automation that I need to manage, allowing me to just enjoy my personal time.</p>
<p>Of course, I’ll keep tracking work projects, since the benefits far outweigh the costs there.</p>

			 <p>When I ran a marathon several years ago, my training plan was just to go for countless long runs. Now that I’m older and wiser, I’m going to be more sophisticated in training for <a href="https://matt.routleynet.org/2021/12/14/after-likely-too.html">Tremblant</a> and that means getting a good coach.</p>
<p>The first question any potential coach has asked is: what is my goal for the race? This is a helpful first sign, since their approach to my training really should be based on my goal. Plus, it has been a good motivator for me to actually share my goal out loud, which helps me think it through.</p>
<p>My goal is to simply finish, while enjoying the race. I’m not aiming for any podium. Although I know it will be tough — the challenge is part of the point, after all — I want to avoid crawling across the finish line, bruised and battered after a long grind. My broader purpose is to use the event as a good excuse to keep active and try out new things. I hope that I’ll be doing events like this for the next decade or so. If the training burns me out or causes injuries, in the pursuit of some unattainable ranking at the event, we’ve missed this purpose.</p>
<p>I’ve also been thinking through what I’m looking for in a coach. There are lots of potentially valid approaches to coaching. I need to find one that aligns with my needs and expectations. In general, there are three things, in order, that I’m looking for.</p>
<ol>
<li>Knowledge: There’s so much to learn! As I said at the beginning, there’s the training plan that mixes all three sports in the right amounts without causing injury. There’s also sorting out nutrition for the race to keep energy optimized. And gear (so much gear!) from bikes to wetsuits and apps to goggles. Without good advice, I could waste a lot of money on shiny, unnecessary gadgets. A seasoned coach can help with all of this.</li>
<li>Community: I’m generally autonomous and would naturally orient towards doing much of my training solo. Despite this, I joined a running group about a month ago and have really enjoyed the camaraderie and support. So, I’ll be looking to a coach to help get me connected with the local community, especially for the cycling. Long-distance rides will be much better with other people.</li>
<li>Accountability: I think I’m pretty goal oriented and persistent (some would say stubborn). I don’t yet know if this will persist over 6 months with significantly more training. Having a coach track my progress, adjusting where necessary, will help keep me honest and on target.</li>
</ol>
<p>Hopefully, not too much to ask for!</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>Inspired by <a href="http://cdevroe.com/">@cedevroe</a>’s <a href="http://cdevroe.com/2021/12/14/unfollowing-everyone-and-everything-again/">semi-regular purges</a>, I’ve gone through my many services and unfollowed, unsubscribed, and deleted everything. And, I mean everything! That’s all of my RSS feeds, newsletters, podcasts, and Micro.blog, Twitter, Instagram, and YouTube accounts. This seemed kind of crazy at first, until I realized that being so attached to these things is rather silly.</p>
<p>Before simply resubscribing to everything, I’m trying to take a more thoughtful approach to why I’m using each of these services.</p>
<p>All of my news feeds are in <a href="https://netnewswire.com">NetNewsWire</a> with <a href="https://feedbin.com">Feedbin</a> as the back end. I&rsquo;d accumulated a few dozen feeds here, the vast majority of which I was consistently just marking all as read. Many were feeds that I thought I <em>should</em> read, rather than actually <em>wanted</em> to read. I&rsquo;m going to resubscribe to just the ones that seemed to consistently yield interesting (to me) articles, like <a href="https://www.quantamagazine.org">Quanta Magazine</a> and <a href="https://aeon.co">Aeon</a>.</p>
<p>As newsletters arrive, I&rsquo;ll unsubscribe from them. If I still see value, I&rsquo;ll transition them over to <a href="https://feedbin.com/blog/2016/02/03/subscribe-to-email-newsletters-in-feedbin/">Feebin</a> and they&rsquo;ll show up among the news feeds. Conceptually this makes sense to me, since they really are just another source of news, rather than actual correspondence to me.</p>
<p>Although I <a href="https://matt.routleynet.org/2019/12/15/declaring-podcasts-bankruptcy.html">cleaned up my podcasts a couple of years ago</a>, I&rsquo;d added a few more since then. I think my original list is still the right one. Nevertheless, I&rsquo;ve unsubscribed from them all and will reintroduce them slowly.</p>
<p>The YouTube algorithms are far too powerful and tempting. So, I&rsquo;m shifting to <a href="https://feedbin.com/blog/2021/01/21/youtube-embeds/">adding specific channels to Feedbin</a>. I like a few science and math oriented channels (such as <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/SteveMould">Steve Mould</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/3blue1brown">3Blue1Brown</a>, and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/standupmaths">Stand-up Maths</a>), the rest were just mindless ways of passing the time.</p>
<p>Instagram used to be where I went to see pictures from friends about their adventures, kids, and pets. Over time my feed had become dominated by brands, especially fitness, beer, and whiskey. Nothing wrong with any of these, obviously, just not what I need to be seeing, So, back to just accounts for people I actually know. As an aside, I was surprised by how easy Instagram makes it to unfollow, including a helpful list of which accounts you interact with the most and the least.</p>
<p>I really like the idea of Twitter as a place to follow my interests. We all know that in practice it can be a pretty nasty place. As an experiment, I&rsquo;m going to try only <a href="https://help.twitter.com/en/using-twitter/follow-and-unfollow-topics">following topics</a> there, rather than people. To be honest, though, I lost my Twitter scrolling habit about halfway through the Trump presidency and I&rsquo;m not that tempted to return.</p>
<p><a href="https://micro.blog">Micro.blog</a> was tricky. As the opposite of Twitter, I&rsquo;ve found lots of nice people having interesting conversations there on a wide array of topics. But, the point of this exercise is to clean out <em>everything</em>, so even here I&rsquo;ve stopped following everyone. I suspect that I&rsquo;ll end up mostly back where I started on this one.</p>
<p>I have to admit feeling a bit disoriented this morning. My usual routine is to scan through all of these sources while waking up with some coffee. There are lots of other things I can be doing in the morning though, starting with actually reading some of the articles I&rsquo;ve accumulated in my ever lengthening read-it-later queue.</p>
<p>Although a purge like this can seem dramatic, I think it can also be therapeutic. Thanks to <a href="http://cdevroe.com/">@cedevroe</a> for prompting this.</p>

		<a href="https://matt.routleynet.org/2021/12/15/improving-my-running.html" class="u-url"><time class="dt-published" datetime="2021-12-15 16:28:00 -0500">Dec 15, 2021</time></a>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>In preparation for <a href="https://matt.routleynet.org/2021/12/14/after-likely-too.html">Tremblant</a>, I had my <a href="https://oneacademylife.com/wellness/">gait analyzed</a> to find out if there are any issues with my running form. I found the process surprisingly thorough and interesting.</p>
<p>Katie (a registered physiotherapist) started out with a general discussion about my running history and goals. Then she filmed me running on a treadmill for about five minutes. We set a fast pace, since that quickly exposes any sloppiness in my running. I have to admit that watching myself running in slow motion was a bit awkward, though my form wasn&rsquo;t as bad as I&rsquo;d imagined.</p>
<p>Katie identified two issues: too much side to side rotation of my arms and a pronounced dip on my left side.</p>
<p>The arms are pretty easy. I just need to be more mindful of how they’re swinging and focus on moving them forwards and backwards, rather than side to side. This better directs my energy towards forward movement.</p>
<p>The dip is more complicated. Katie tried a bunch of different strength tests to isolate the muscle and we found that my left glute was much stronger than my right, which is odd, given I&rsquo;m right handed. To distinguish between strength and muscle activation, Katie tried an acupuncture needle in my right hip. Remarkably, just a couple of minutes later, I was then much stronger on the right side. We did another round on the treadmill and my hips were now nicely aligned.</p>
<p>This suggested to Katie that my strength is fine, rather it&rsquo;s insufficient muscle activation that is leading to the dip. She prescribed some warmup exercises to help. I know that I have a deficient warm up routine (as in there isn&rsquo;t one, I just start running), so this is a good excuse to improve this component of my running routine.</p>
<p>As someone that generally just puts on running shoes and gets going, I&rsquo;m glad I put in some time to understand my gait and identify some opportunities for improvement. I hope to be running for many more years and this should help minimize injuries.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>My iPhone Home Screen <a href="https://matt.routleynet.org/2019/06/09/my-iphone-home.html">continues</a> to <a href="https://matt.routleynet.org/2020/09/22/trying-out-a.html">evolve</a> and, now that we have <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT212608">Focus Modes</a>, I’ve made some further adjustments.</p>
<p><img src="https://matt.routleynet.org/uploads/2021/7d1e7a077f.png" alt="Screenshot of three iOS HomeScreens based on Focus Modes"></p>
<p>From left to right, I’m using three different Focus Modes: Personal, Work, and Fitness. The first two are entirely widget focused, while Fitness has a few app icons as well.</p>
<p>The dock has <a href="https://getdrafts.com/">Drafts</a> which, as the tagline says, is where text starts. This hasn’t changed from <a href="https://matt.routleynet.org/2019/06/09/my-iphone-home.html">my earlier setups</a>. The second icon launches a front-end Shortcut for Apple Notes. As I described in my <a href="https://matt.routleynet.org/2021/11/06/lessons-from-using.html">Apple Note overview</a>, this is an idea that I’ve borrowed from <a href="https://www.matthewcassinelli.com/shortcuts/note-taker/">Matthew Cassinelli</a> and provides a flexible interface to the app.</p>
<h2 id="personal">Personal</h2>
<p>From top left, my Personal Home Screen starts with a stack of Reminders filtered to my Personal list, Fantastical, and Streaks. This is essentially my “what should I be doing” stack.</p>
<p>Next is a stack with Photos and Siri Suggestions. The Photos widget consistently surfaces delightful photos, so I’ve given it a prominent spot. While the usefulness of Siri Suggestions are variable, I like the idea of my phone learning my habits and showing me relevant actions.</p>
<p>Through the middle, I have Weather on the left and the right is a stack of Apple Music and Overcast, which are my options for listening to something.</p>
<p>On the bottom left is a stack of Timery and Screen Time. These are there to keep me mindful of what I’m actually doing, especially on weekends. The Timery widget shows me a summary view of my projects. So, in this screenshot I’ve put in an hour on exercise, another hour on reading, and 20 minutes with some household chores. The Screen Time widget helps keep me honest about how much I’m using my devices, especially on weekends when I really should be looking at something <a href="https://matt.routleynet.org/2020/12/28/year-of-the.html">besides a screen</a>.</p>
<p>And on the bottom right is a stack of Day One and Notes, filtered to my Personal folder. Day One is there for capturing family events and reflections. While the Notes folder often has some useful reference material for our weekend activities.</p>
<h2 id="work">Work</h2>
<p>Curiously, my Work Home Screen is less complicated than my Personal one.</p>
<p>The top is a stack with Fantastical and Mail’s VIP widget. I’m not entirely convinced that the Mail widget is useful here. I almost always just want Fantastical reminding me of my next meeting or task.</p>
<p>Given the more variable number of tasks I tend to be doing while in work mode, I’ve got the Siri Suggestions widget in the middle. I took this screenshot on the weekend, so it isn’t indicative of what it usually shows, which tends to be one of the Shortcuts that I’m often launching to manage my workday.</p>
<p>Intentionally mirroring my Personal HomeScreen, the bottom row is a stack with two Timery widgets and a stack of two Notes widgets, one filtered to my Work folder and the other to my Meetings folder.</p>
<h2 id="fitness">Fitness</h2>
<p>The Fitness Home Screen is mostly an experiment. I spend the vast majority of my time in one of the other two Focus Modes, so I’m not yet convinced that I need any other Home Screens.</p>
<p>Regardless, this one has the Fitness widget at the top for seemingly obvious reasons.</p>
<p>The middle row has the <a href="https://matt.routleynet.org/2021/08/08/readiness-to-train.html">Training Today widget</a> to help keep me honest about rest. And then a cluster of icons on the right. The only one that is non-standard is “Workout mix”, which is just a Shortcut to launch a good playlist in Apple Music.</p>
<p>The bottom row has Carrot Weather to make sure I’m not about to get rained on when heading out for a run. I’ve also added the Batteries widget there to make sure my Apple Watch and AirPods are ready for action.</p>
<hr>
<p>I’ve set up Personal Automations to automatically switch between my Personal and Work Home Screens at 8:45 and 17:30. I’ve found these good reminders to keep my work activities within reasonable office hours. Starting a Workout automatically switches to the Fitness Home Screen.</p>
<p>There’s almost endless scope for fiddling with these. So, by writing them here, I’m adding some accountability to just stop that and use them for a while before making further changes.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>Now that I’m <a href="https://matt.routleynet.org/2021/11/06/lessons-from-using.html">committed to using Apple Notes</a>, I wanted a way to download my <a href="https://news.micro.blog/2020/09/29/press-release-microblog.html">Micro.blog Highlights</a> into Notes.</p>
<p>I like using Bookmarks as a read-it-later service and the highlighting feature is great for quickly blogging excerpts from articles. For longer-term storage, though, and integration with the rest of my notes, it is much better to have the content of the highlights stored within Notes.</p>
<p>So, here’s a Shortcut <a href="https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/d466d38eecb64bc8bbb4516489e2930e">Micro.blog Highlights to Notes</a> that does exactly this. The Shortcut checks first to see if the highlight is already captured in a note to prevent duplication. It also checks to see if there’s already a note for the webpage, just with a different highlight, and appends the highlight to that note, instead of creating a new one.</p>
<p>At least, that’s the idea. I’ve found these checks very unreliable. Sometimes the Shortcut finds the match and appends, and sometimes it doesn’t and creates a new one. Part of the problem seems to be that if there’s any punctuation in the content, the Notes filter fails. For example, searching for “We begin with an obstinate fact:” fails, then remove the “:” and the search work fine. I can use regular expressions to remove all punctuation, but then my notes are all mangled.</p>
<p>After fiddling around with this for a while, I’m just going to move along and assume it is a bug in the Notes actions for Shortcuts. Perhaps not a fair conclusion. The worst case is that I get one note per highlight, rather than just one note per article, and sporadically a note is duplicated. This isn’t so bad, and debugging Shortcuts can be a nuisance. Given this, the Shortcut is likely better used in an empty Notes folder, that is, delete all the previously downloaded Highlights first.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>Back in September, I <a href="https://matt.routleynet.org/2021/09/15/surprising-no-one.html">committed to using Apple Notes for three months</a>. The goal was to focus on my use cases for writing, rather than fiddling with new apps continuously.</p>
<p>Here’s what I’ve identified so far. Many of the approaches and features that I’m using in these use cases are readily available in other apps and often Notes is not the most efficient choice. Now that I’ve documented these use cases, I’d like to use them to assess alternative apps.</p>
<h2 id="meeting-notes">Meeting notes</h2>
<p>Thanks to <a href="https://timeryapp.com/">Timery</a>, I know that 60% of my working time is spent in meeting. So many meetings!</p>
<p>For each one, I create a note to capture ideas, useful information, and tasks. I’ve automated this with a couple of Shortcuts. The one I use the most is “<a href="https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/ec04ef510bc14168bf0394fc083eceb5">Start My Next Meeting</a>”. This presents me with a list of upcoming meetings. I choose from the list and it creates a meeting note, starts a Timery timer, and opens the link to start the video call (typically Teams). The meeting note has the name of the meeting as the title, adds tags for #meeting and the Timery project, adds the date and time of the meeting, a list of attendees, and any notes from the calendar event. From this structure, I can then add notes throughout the meeting and extract any tasks into Reminders later.</p>
<p>I used <a href="https://matt.routleynet.org/2019/10/15/task-management-with.html">Agenda</a> for these sorts of notes before, which was powerful.</p>
<h2 id="daily-summaries">Daily summaries</h2>
<p>Occasionally, I find myself at the end of a week with no clear sense of what I actually accomplished. To help with this, for the past year I’ve been recording the top three things I’ve done in a day into <a href="http://dayoneapp.com/">Day One</a> (the <a href="https://dayoneapp.com/blog/its-time-for-templates">5 Minute PM template</a> has been great for this).</p>
<p>To augment this, I’ve been using another Shortcut to create a <a href="https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/952ca340b26a4c689710b9855d4c0a23">Daily Work Report</a>. This makes a note of the meetings I attended, tasks I completed, and tasks I created. These all get saved to a Daily Notes folder. I then use the day’s work report to pull out the highlights for Day One. There’s some redundancy here, though I find the process of choosing just three things for Day One is helpful.</p>
<p>Overall, I think that Day One is a better app for this use case.</p>
<h2 id="project-notes">Project notes</h2>
<p>For each of my projects, I create a project note that states the purpose or objective of the project, key stakeholders, and timelines. Then I accumulate relevant notes and documents while making progress on the project. Creating these are also done via a <a href="https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/25e882b266dd42c9a2b19933f3b7934a" title="Shortcut">simple Shortcut</a>. I’ve experimented with using checklists for tasks in these notes, but find it isn’t as effective as my approach with <a href="https://matt.routleynet.org/2019/10/15/task-management-with.html">MindNode</a> and Reminders.</p>
<p>Once I finish a project, the associated note gets cleaned up and moved to an Archive folder to keep it out of the way.</p>
<h2 id="research">Research</h2>
<p>This is a rather broad category and, unlike the previous use cases, is for both work and personal notes. Much of this is capturing facts, quotes, and sources. If it is project specific, they go to the project note. Some are more generic and are kept as a standalone note. All of them get tags to help provide some structure. This is where Apple Notes ability to accept almost anything from the share sheet is powerful.</p>
<p>The new <a href="https://www.macstories.net/stories/fast-capture-with-quick-note-for-ipad-and-mac-the-macstories-overview/">Quick Notes feature</a> has been interesting for research. The ability to quickly highlight and then resurrect content on websites is great. I find actually working with the quick notes is pretty clumsy though. They have to stay in the Quick Notes folder and choosing which one to send content to can be tricky. I think there’s some great potential here and will keep experimenting.</p>
<p>For any webpages that I want to archive, I use <a href="https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/7b50dcf65d0e4b08870eb5c3d4efb109">another Shortcut</a> that creates a plain-text note of the webpage along with some metadata and then adds the link to <a href="https://www.pinboard.com/">Pinboard</a>. This has been surprisingly useful for recipes, when all I really want are the ingredients and steps, rather than the long history of the recipe’s development.</p>
<h2 id="other-nice-features">Other nice features</h2>
<p>In addition to these use cases, there are a few nice features of Apple Notes that are worth mentioning.</p>
<ul>
<li>As should be apparent from above, creating useful Shortcuts for Apple Notes is straightforward. In some sense, it is the Shortcuts that I’m finding really useful. Apple Notes is just the final destination for the content.</li>
<li>I’ve set up widgets by focus mode so that the most recent notes are shown on my Home Screen in the right context. These are restricted to a particular folder and sorted by date modified.</li>
<li>The formatting options are comprehensive, including table support.</li>
<li>I think I like the feature where checking off tasks moves them to the bottom of the list. Most of the time, this is what I want.</li>
<li>The iCloud web app is convenient for using notes on my Windows work PC. Unfortunately, I’ve found the syncing to be rather unreliable here, where notes just don’t show up in the web app sometimes.</li>
<li>I don’t share notes as often as I expected. When I do, it works really well.</li>
<li>Not really specific to Apple Notes, but I stole an idea from <a href="https://www.matthewcassinelli.com/shortcuts/note-taker/">Matthew Cassinelli</a> to aggregate all of these Notes Shortcuts into one super Shortcut that creates a list of Shortcuts to choose from.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="challenges">Challenges</h2>
<p>There are a few things that don’t work as well as they should:</p>
<ul>
<li>Searching is too limited. In particular, you can’t narrow searches to particular folders. Most of the time I either only want to search my meeting notes or not include them. I had to set up a <a href="https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/8583784c018b4d5c9df1947e24dfcd01">Shortcut</a> that takes a search term as an input and then asks me to specify which folder to search. This should be built into the app’s search field.</li>
<li>Linking among notes isn’t really supported. You can sort of do this with url searches for note titles. Pretty clunky though.</li>
<li>Given how much I use Shortcuts for Apple Notes, it is frustrating how little you can do when creating a note. In particular, you can’t style text or add tags. Every time I use Shortcuts to create a note, the first thing I have to do is apply title and heading styles and convert any words prefixed with a # into an actual tag.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="other-use-cases">Other use cases</h2>
<p>I’ve found a few use cases that don’t yet fit in with Apple Notes. I’m using <a href="https://getdrafts.com/">Drafts</a> for all of these:</p>
<ul>
<li>Blog posts</li>
<li>Drafting long emails</li>
<li>Capturing and processing transitory texts, which Drafts is really optimized for</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<p>Restricting myself to Apple Notes was a helpful trick for crystallizing my use cases. Now that I’m three months in, I think I’ll stick with Apple Notes for a while longer. I’ve built up a good ecosystem of Shortcuts for working with the app and, of course, now have lots of content in the app.</p>

<p>The most radical change to our shared social lives isn’t who gets to speak, it’s what we can hear. True, everyone has access to their own little megaphone, and there is endless debate about whether that’s good or bad, but the vast majority of people aren’t reaching a huge audience. And yet at any single moment just about anyone with a smartphone has the ability to surveil millions of people across the globe.</p>

			<h1><a href="https://matt.routleynet.org/2021/10/30/switching-to-icloud.html">Switching to iCloud&#43; Custom Email Domain 📧 </a></h1>
		

		<a href="https://matt.routleynet.org/2021/10/30/switching-to-icloud.html" class="u-url"><time class="dt-published" datetime="2021-10-30 11:32:15 -0500">Oct 30, 2021</time></a>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>I&rsquo;ve switched my personal email over to <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-ca/HT212514">Apple&rsquo;s custom email domain with iCloud Mail</a>. A roughly ranked list of reasons for the switch is:</p>
<ol>
<li>One less account to worry about. Not that it was a big deal, but now I don&rsquo;t need to know the various setup details for my personal email. Once I&rsquo;ve logged into my iCloud account, my email is ready.</li>
<li>I appreciate <a href="https://www.apple.com/privacy/">Apple&rsquo;s commitment to privacy</a> and trust that they&rsquo;ll apply this commitment to my email account.</li>
<li>I&rsquo;m already paying for iCloud+ and, so, might as well use this feature and save some money by not paying for separate email hosting.</li>
<li>I&rsquo;m actively using Reminders and Notes in iCloud.com and the Mail interface there is decent, certainly better than the rudimentary one offered by my previous email host.</li>
</ol>
<p>Setup was straightforward with <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-ca/HT212524">clear instructions</a>. Having said that, the only issue I had was that initiating the setup process simply didn&rsquo;t work for a few weeks. I tried a couple of times a week and each time I just got a generic error. Then, for no apparent reason, one day it worked. I suspect this was just an issue with rolling out a new service.</p>
<p>I should point out that my email needs are very basic for this personal account. I don&rsquo;t need many automated rules, tagging, or filtering. So, iCloud Mail is fine. I wouldn&rsquo;t switch over my work account (even if corporate IT would allow it). I get something like 100x the email at work and need more sophisticated tools.</p>
<p>Besides the initial trouble with initiating the setup, everything has been working well for the past week. I&rsquo;m well aware of Apple&rsquo;s well-earned reputation for challenges with internet services and will be staying vigilant for at least the next few weeks. One of the great benefits of having my own domain name is the ease with which I can switch mail hosts.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p><a href="https://www.statcan.gc.ca/eng/start">Statistics Canada</a> has a wealth of data that are essential for good public policy. Often a good third of my analytical scripts are devoted to accessing and processing data from the Statistics Canada website, which always seems like a waste of effort and good opportunity for making silly errors. So, I was keen to test out the <a href="https://mountainmath.github.io/cansim/index.html"><code>cansim</code>package</a> for R to see how it might help. The quick answer is &ldquo;very much&rdquo;.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://mountainmath.github.io/cansim/articles/cansim.html">documentation</a> for the <code>cansim</code> package is thorough and doesn&rsquo;t need to be repeated here. I thought it might be useful to illustrate how helpful the package can be by refactoring <a href="https://matt.routleynet.org/2020/01/10/things-cost-more.html">some earlier work</a> that explored consumer price inflation.</p>
<p>These scripts always start off with downloading and extracting the relevant data file:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-R" data-lang="R">cpi_url <span style="color:#f92672">&lt;-</span> <span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/n1/tbl/csv/18100004-eng.zip&#34;</span> <span style="color:#75715e"># (1)</span>
<span style="color:#a6e22e">if</span>(<span style="color:#a6e22e">file.exists</span>(<span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;18100004-eng.zip&#34;</span>)) { <span style="color:#75715e"># (2)</span>
    <span style="color:#75715e"># Already downloaded</span>

  }
cpi <span style="color:#f92672">&lt;-</span> readr<span style="color:#f92672">::</span><span style="color:#a6e22e">read_csv</span>(<span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;18100004.csv&#34;</span>) <span style="color:#75715e"># (4)</span>
</code></pre></div><p>A few things to note here:</p>
<ol>
<li>You need to know the url for the data. Sometimes the logic is clear and you can guess, but often that doesn&rsquo;t work and you need to spelunk through the Stats Can website</li>
<li>To avoid downloading the file every time I run the script, there&rsquo;s a test to see if the file already exists</li>
<li>This approach yields lots of files and folders that you need to manage, including making sure they&rsquo;re ignored by version control</li>
<li>Using the great <code>readr</code> package imports the final csv file</li>
</ol>
<p>With <code>cansim</code> all I need to know is the data series number:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-R" data-lang="R">cansim_table <span style="color:#f92672">&lt;-</span> <span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;18-10-0004&#34;</span>
cpi <span style="color:#f92672">&lt;-</span> cansim<span style="color:#f92672">::</span><span style="color:#a6e22e">get_cansim</span>(cansim_table)
</code></pre></div><p><code>get_cansim</code>downloads the right file to a temporary directory, extracts the data, and imports it as a <code>tidyverse</code>-compatible data frame.</p>
<p>The <code>get_cansim</code> function has some other nice features. It automatically creates a <code>Date</code> column with the right type, inferred from the standard <code>REF_DATE</code> column. And, it also creates a <code>val_norm</code> column that intelligently converts the <code>VALUE</code> column. For example, converting percentage or thousand-dollar values into standard formats.</p>
<p>The <code>cansim</code> package is a great example of a really helpful utility package that allows me to focus on analysis, rather than fiddling around with data. Definitely worth checking out if you deal with data from Statistics Canada.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>It seems that a 44-year-old French man had gone to hospital complaining of a mild weakness in his left leg. Doctors learned that the patient ‘had a shunt inserted into his head to drain away hydrocephalus – water on the brain – as an infant. The shunt was removed when he was 14.’ When they scanned his brain, they found a huge fluid-filled chamber occupying most of the space in his skull, leaving little more than a thin sheet of actual brain tissue. The patient, a married father of two children, worked as a civil servant apparently leading a normal life, despite having a cranium filled with spinal fluid and very little brain tissue.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Before you know it, people have starkly different views on the matter, and their views are based on perfectly solid research. The point here is not that we can’t know anything, it’s simply that the world is a complex place, and that the search for simplicity is very often what gets us into trouble. For scholars, the most important thing is to strive to present their work in a way that’s as objective as possible (accuracy), and to present a range of reasonable results wherever possible, giving the fullest possible picture (sincerity).</p>

			 <p>I&rsquo;m trying to sequence my workouts in a more systematic way to avoid overtraining. I&rsquo;ve found <a href="https://trainingtodayapp.com/">Training Today</a> really helpful in determining this Readiness To Train (RTT). The app uses data collected by my Apple Watch to provide a straightforward indicator of how ambitious I should be on any particular day.</p>
<p>As an example, here&rsquo;s today&rsquo;s evaluation:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>This matches how I feel 🥴. So, today was a good day for some <a href="https://www.litethriive.com">recuperative yoga</a>.</p>
<p>Scrolling back to Thursday, everything looked much better and I put in a good <a href="https://oneacademylife.com/virtual/">HIIT session</a>:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Of course, the whole point of doing this is to adjust my training to match how my body is recovering. I clearly didn&rsquo;t do this on Friday. Rather than catch up on some sleep, I choose to do a moderate workout and my RTT stayed on the floor. Not great, considering I&rsquo;d signed up for an intense <a href="https://fb.watch/7fVgb-hxZG/">One Academy Endure Challenge</a> on Saturday. I managed to finish, which is the main goal, but it didn&rsquo;t feel good.</p>
<p>Comparing my RTT for this week&rsquo;s Endure Challenge with the last one shows how this indicator can be informative:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>My RTT was much higher back then and I felt really good during the challenge. This gives me comfort that RTT is actually <a href="https://trainingtodayapp.com/blog/how-much-can-i-trust-hrv-are-the-measurements-accurate">measuring something real</a> and actionable.</p>
<p>The Apple Watch screenshots shown above are part of the free version of the Training Today app. The more detailed chart above is included in a one-time in-app purchase. This gets you details like this:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>And a simple widget, shown below on my fitness <a href="https://www.macstories.net/stories/three-weeks-with-ios-and-ipados-15-foundational-updates/">home screen</a>:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>I really like the focussed simplicity of Training Today, along with the straightforward one-time purchase. My Apple Watch is collecting lots of data about me and I&rsquo;m glad I can use it to better manage my fitness.</p>

Now, though, Craft has <a href="https://support.craft.do/hc/en-us/articles/360021080858-Calendar-integration-Daily-Notes">added calendar integration</a> and I&rsquo;m testing it out.</p>
<p>There are several things I really like about Craft, relative to Agenda:</p>
<ol>
<li>Document syncing is far more reliable. This isn&rsquo;t entirely Agenda&rsquo;s fault. I&rsquo;m restricted by corporate policy from using iCloud Documents, so have been using Dropbox sync for Agenda. I often have to wait an indeterminate, though long, time before documents sync across my devices. Craft sync has been instantaneous and very reliable.</li>
<li>Having access to my documents from a web browser is great. I&rsquo;ll be back to working from the office on a Windows laptop soon and won&rsquo;t have access to my iPad. So, web access will be important.</li>
<li>Performance is much better on Craft. Agenda often freezes in the middle of typing and suffers from random crashes. This could very well be something about my particular setup, though it doesn&rsquo;t happen in any other apps.</li>
</ol>
<p>On the downside, I do miss Agenda&rsquo;s simplicity. Craft has lots of ways to organize notes (such as cards and subpages). Of course, you can mostly ignore this, but I like Agenda&rsquo;s well-thought-through approach that didn&rsquo;t require much deliberation about where to put things.</p>
<p>Of course, having just made this switch, Apple announced <a href="https://twitter.com/viticci/status/1402007203435909121?s=21">Quick Notes</a> and I may well be back on Apple Notes in a few months.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>It appears that simple creatures — including, now, the brainless hydra — can sleep. And the intriguing implication of that finding is that sleep’s original role, buried billions of years back in life’s history, may have been very different from the standard human conception of it. If sleep does not require a brain, then it may be a profoundly broader phenomenon than we supposed.</p>

<p>In retrospect, it is obvious that the Gen X obsession with authenticity was anxiety caused by the growing rumblings of a culture in transition. The old technological ecosystem that fuelled the counterculture was gone, but the new web-enabled environment that made authenticity irrelevant hadn’t quite yet arrived. Gen X was the last generation to possess genuine subcultures that were able to remain somewhat unmolested by the digital meat grinder. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Thinking about reincarnation today is, first of all, a reminder of the complexity of Buddhism, and the fact that individual practices can’t be neatly separated from broader institutional histories. Any change in our personal lives is inseparable from change in the world around us. Second, reincarnation offers a way of thinking about the present as connected to the deep past and to any potential futures as well. We needn’t think of the specifics of the reincarnation doctrine to realise that we’re all the inheritors of a past that we didn’t create and the bequeathers of a future we won’t live to see. Third, this temporal relation is also an ethical one, because it suggests that we’re the products of other lives and the creators of other futures, and thus share a global and temporal interdependence. And fourth, it follows that part of our task as humans is to be aware of what we might accidentally replicate from our past and thus unknowingly recreate in the future.</p>

<p>Scientific efforts to shed light on the prehistory of clothes have received an unexpected boost from another line of research, the study of clothing lice, or body lice. These blood-sucking insects make their home mainly on clothes and they evolved from head lice when people began to use clothes on a regular basis. Research teams in Germany and the United States analysed the genomes of head and clothing lice to estimate when the clothing parasites split from the head ones.</p>

<p>I won’t spoil the list, other than to say that I strongly agree with the first one: <em>All data are created; data never simply exist</em>. We rarely put enough thought or effort into planning how data will be generated, and then have to make up for this in the modelling phase.</p>
<p>Our models are always dependent on the quality of data we put into them. And, yet, we often spend much more time refining and testing our models than we do with our input data and the production process that generates them.</p>

<p>I agree with Matt Gurney&rsquo;s take:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>So Picard, really, is something I&rsquo;d be judging on two entirely different levels: as a part of an existing Star Trek legacy, but also as a new addition to it. It&rsquo;s a new show, and must be judged on its own merits, but it&rsquo;s also a direct continuation of TNG, and must be judged on that basis, as well.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>There&rsquo;s been a fair bit of <a href="https://micro.blog/SteveSawczyn/10839912">discussion</a> over on Micro.blog about podcast players recently. I&rsquo;ve switched among <a href="https://overcast.fm/">Overcast</a>, <a href="https://castro.fm/">Castro</a>, and <a href="https://apps.apple.com/ca/app/apple-podcasts/id525463029">Apple Podcasts</a> players over the years and, mostly to help myself think it through (again), here are my thoughts.</p>
<p>For me, there are three main criteria: audio quality, episode management, and OS integration. Though, I completely understand that others may have different criteria.</p>
<p>Like most podcast listeners, I listen at high speed, usually around 1.5x, which can distort the audio. Apple Podcasts player is definitely the worst for this criterion. For me, Overcast&rsquo;s smart speed and voice boost features give it the edge over Castro, in terms of audio quality at increased speeds.</p>
<p>Castro is definitely the player of choice if you subscribe to more podcasts than you can listen to. The queue management features in Castro are very good. You can replicate some of this with Overcast, but that isn&rsquo;t one of the app&rsquo;s main features. Apple Podcasts player doesn&rsquo;t offer much in this regard. Despite listing this as a criterion, I&rsquo;ve actually elevated to subscription, rather than episode, triage. I <a href="https://matt.routleynet.org/2019/12/15/declaring-podcasts-bankruptcy.html">carefully curate my list of podcasts</a> and don&rsquo;t add new ones very often. Given this, Overcast&rsquo;s approach is more than sufficient for me.</p>
<p>OS integration is a bit unfair, as Apple has given themselves some nice features that independent app developers aren&rsquo;t able to use. Nonetheless, Apple does a good job of intermixing podcasts and music into their Siri-powered widgets in iOS and the HomePods. With my <a href="https://matt.routleynet.org/2020/12/28/year-of-the.html">reinforced interest</a> in less screen time and use of <a href="https://matt.routleynet.org/2020/09/22/trying-out-a.html">home screen widgets</a>, Apple Podcasts wins out here. This may change once Overcast releases a widget.</p>
<p>As just one example of the integration, here’s what happens when I plug headphones into my iPhone: a selection of music playlists and podcasts appears. I use this feature <em>a lot</em>.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>After all that, I&rsquo;m using Apple Podcasts for now, mostly to take advantage of the OS integrations while I&rsquo;m experimenting with a widget-based iPhone. I&rsquo;m quite certain this is short term and that I&rsquo;ll return to Overcast soon. In addition to the better audio quality, Overcast also has some nice refinements, like per subscription speed settings (I like to play music podcasts at 1x) and skip-forward amounts (<a href="https://www.cbc.ca/listen/live-radio/1-51-quirks-and-quarks">Quirks and Quarks</a>, for example, always has a two-minute preamble that I skip). These small refinements are typically what distinguishes the stock Apple apps from good indie apps.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m glad there are so many solid apps for podcast listening. Whatever your preferences, there&rsquo;s sure to be one for you.</p>

			 <p>Season 3 of Star Trek: Discovery was entertaining. Despite some awkward plots that were perhaps necessary to get to the right ending, they really did well with character moments. My only disappointment was the diminishment of Saru in the last few episodes. The sudden conflict he felt about choosing between Kaminar and the Federation seemed really out of character to me. Despite that, I like where they ended and look forward to S4 🖖</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>Like any 12-year old, my son is pretty keen on gaming. As an all Apple house, his options were a bit constrained. So, we decided to build a PC from components.</p>
<p>I’d last built a PC about 30 years ago, when I wasn’t much older than him. I remember thinking it was cool to be using a machine I’d built myself, plus as a parent it seemed like a good educational experience. I have to admit to being a bit nervous about the whole thing, as there was certainly a scenario in which we spent an entire weekend unsuccessfully trying to get a bunch of malfunctioning components to work.</p>
<p>After much deliberation and analysis, we ordered our parts from <a href="https://www.newegg.ca">Newegg</a> and everything arrived within a couple of weeks.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Following along with <a href="https://youtu.be/npGL2-pRXlU">this great step-by-step video</a>, we assembled the components.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>Given my initial anxiety, I was <em>very</em> relieved when we saw this screen. The BIOS booted up and showed that the RAM, SSD, and other components were all properly connected.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>With that done, we then got to what ended up being the complicated part. Evidently part of the point of a gaming PC is to have lots of fans and lights. None of this was true when I was a kid and there were a daunting number of wires required to power the lights and fans. Sorting this out actually took a fair bit of time. But, eventually success!</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Then our last challenge, which I likely should have anticipated much sooner. We didn&rsquo;t bother ordering a DVD drive, since everything is online these days. But, our Windows installation showed up as a DVD and we couldn&rsquo;t create any Windows install media on our Apple devices. Fortunately, we checked in with a slightly older kid down the street and he provided us with a USB drive with the right software. With that challenge solved, we finished the project!</p>
<p>Not counting choosing the components online, the whole project took about 5 hours from opening the boxes to booting into Windows for the first time. I&rsquo;d definitely recommend it to anyone that&rsquo;s tempted and technically inclined. My son is quite excited to be using a computer that he built from parts.</p>

			 <p>Having spent countless hours in grad school arguing about frequentist and Bayesian statistics, I appreciate <a href="https://richarddmorey.medium.com/the-value-of-p-212bcfb1ed66">Richard D. Morey’s take</a> on the importance of p values:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The mistake many statistical commentators make is to interpret the p value as attempt at a quantification of evidence, or as a posterior probability. It is none of these things, nor is it meant to be. It should not even, really, be thought of as means to make an inference (although, it is in the most simplistic interpretation of the Neyman-Pearson paradigm). It is, instead, a means to critique a potential inference.</p>

			 <p>Staying in touch with my team is important. So, I schedule a skip-level meeting with someone on the team each week. These informal conversations are great for getting to know everyone, finding out about new ideas, and learning about recent achievements.</p>
<p>Getting these organized across a couple of dozen people is logistically challenging and I’ve developed a Shortcut to automate most of the process.</p>
<p>Borrowing from <a href="https://heyscottyj.com/2020/05/05/automating-emails-with-data-jar/">Scotty Jackson</a>, I have a base in <a href="https://airtable.com">AirTable</a> with a record for each team member. I use this to store all sorts of useful information about everyone, including when we last had a skip-level meeting. The Shortcut uses this field to pull out team members that I haven&rsquo;t met with in the past four months and then randomizes the list of names. Then it passes each name over to <a href="https://matt.routleynet.org/2020/10/01/supporting-my-favourite.html">Fantastical</a> while also incrementing the date by a week. The end result is a recurring set of weekly meetings, randomized across team members.</p>
<p>The hardest part of the Shortcut development was figuring out how to get the names in a random order. A big thank you to <a href="https://talk.automators.fm/u/sylumer/summary">sylumer</a> in the Automators forum for <a href="https://talk.automators.fm/t/deleting-items-from-data-jar/9620/4?u=mroutley">pointing out</a> that the Files action can randomly sort any list, not just lists of files.</p>
<p>I’m not sharing the Shortcut here, since the implementation is very specific to my needs. Rather, I’m sharing some of the thinking behind the code, since I think that it demonstrates the general utility of something like Shortcuts for managing routine tasks with just a small amount of upfront effort.</p>

			<h1><a href="https://matt.routleynet.org/2020/12/28/year-of-the.html">Year of the Tangible</a></h1>
		

		<a href="https://matt.routleynet.org/2020/12/28/year-of-the.html" class="u-url"><time class="dt-published" datetime="2020-12-28 12:12:00 -0500">Dec 28, 2020</time></a>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>Inspired by <a href="https://overcast.fm/+E7b4kA8-g">Coretex</a>, I’m declaring <strong>Tangible</strong> as my theme for 2021.</p>
<p>I’ve chosen this theme because I want to spend less time looking at a screen and more time with &ldquo;tangible stuff”. I’m sure that this is a common sentiment and declaring this theme will keep me focused on improvements.</p>
<p>Since working from home with an iPad, I’m averaging about 9 hours a day with an iOS device. This isn’t just a vague estimate; Screen Time gives me to-the-minute tracking of every app I’m actively using.</p>
<p>A generic day is something like:</p>
<ol>
<li><a href="https://www.litethriive.com">Exercise</a> via Zoom in the morning</li>
<li>Meditate with <a href="https://www.wakingup.com/">Waking Up</a> on the iPhone</li>
<li>Read <a href="https://ranchero.com/netnewswire/">news</a> on my iPad while having breakfast</li>
<li>Back and forth between Teams (almost 3 hours a day!) and Outlook on the iPad throughout the work day</li>
<li><a href="https://youtube.com/c/andycrowley">Learning guitar</a> on YouTube and reading books in the iPad in the evening</li>
</ol>
<p>Throw in some Netflix, journaling in <a href="https://dayoneapp.com">DayOne</a>, <a href="https://micro.blog">social networking</a>, and <a href="https://youtube.com/greymatter">random YouTube videos</a> and I’m spending an incredible amount of time looking at a screen.</p>
<p>I’m certainly not a Luddite! The ability of these rectangles of glass to take on so many functions and provide so much meaningful content is astounding. There’s just something unsettling about the dominant role they play.</p>
<p>So, a few things I plan to try:</p>
<ul>
<li>Although I’ll continue reading ebooks, since the convenience is so great, I’ll be rotating paper books into the queue regularly.</li>
<li>I’ve lost my running outdoor routine. Getting that back will be a nice addition to the Zoom classes and add in some very much needed fresh air.</li>
<li>As a family, we’ve been enjoying playing board games on weekends, just not routinely. Making sure we play at least one game a week will be good for all of us.</li>
<li>My son is keen on electronics. We’re going to try assembling a gaming PC for him from components, as well as learn some basic electronics with a breadboard and Arduino.</li>
<li>Our dog will be excited to get out for more regular walks with especially long ones on the weekend.</li>
</ul>
<p>I’ll be adding much of this to <a href="https://apps.apple.com/ca/app/streaks/id963034692">Streaks</a>, an app that I’ve found really helpful for building habits. I&rsquo;ll also add a &ldquo;tangible&rdquo; tag to my <a href="https://apps.apple.com/ca/app/timery-for-toggl/id1425368544">time tracker</a> to quantify the shift.</p>
<p>My hope is that I can find the right balance of screen time and tangible activities with intention.</p>

<p><a href="https://mindnode.com/">MindNode</a> is indispensable to my workflow. My main use for it is in <a href="https://matt.routleynet.org/2019/10/15/task-management-with.html">tracking all of my projects and tasks</a>, supported by MindNode&rsquo;s Reminders integration. I can see all of my projects, grouped by areas of focus, simultaneously which is great for weekly reviews and for prioritizing my work.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve also found it really helpful for sketching out project plans. I can get ideas out of my head easily with quick entry and then drag and drop nodes to explore connections. Seeing connections among items and rearranging them really brings out the critical elements.</p>
<p>MindNode&rsquo;s design is fantastic and the app makes it really easy to apply styles across nodes. The relatively recent addition of tags has been great too. Overall, one of my most used apps.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Waiting pulls us into the present unlike any other experience of time. In the waiting, we realise that this moment is meaningful as it exists, not as some step toward a future moment. Waiting is present tense, and its meanings are full of the potential to transform the ways in which we see the world. Each moment is its own experience and its own fulfilment.</p>

			 <p>I&rsquo;ve been negligent in supporting some of my favourite apps on the App Store. In many cases, I reviewed the app a few years ago and then never refreshed my ratings. So, I&rsquo;m making a new commitment to updating my reviews for apps by picking at least one each month to refresh.</p>
<p>First up is <a href="https://flexibits.com/">Fantastical</a>. This one took a real hit when they switched to a subscription pricing model. I get the controversy with subscriptions in general. For me, Fantastical has earned a spot on my short list of apps that I support with an ongoing subscription.</p>
<p>And here&rsquo;s my App Store review:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Fantastical is a great app and is definitely one of my top three most-used apps. Well worth the subscription price.</p>
<p>A few favourite features:</p>
<ul>
<li>Integration of events and tasks into the calendar view</li>
<li>Access to event attachments</li>
<li>Automatic link detection for Teams and Zoom meetings</li>
</ul>

			 <p>With the release of iOS 7, I&rsquo;m reconsidering my <a href="https://matt.routleynet.org/2019/06/09/my-iphone-home.html">earlier approach to the Home Screen</a>. So far I&rsquo;m trying out a fully automated first screen that uses the Smart Stack, Siri Suggestions, and Shortcut widgets. These are all automatically populated, based on anticipated use and have been quite prescient.</p>
<p><img src="https://matt.routleynet.org/uploads/2020/72f02dbcc4.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>My second screen is all widgets with views from apps that I want to have always available. Although the dynamic content on the first screen has been really good, I do want some certainty about accessing specific content. This second screen replaces how I was using the <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT207122">Today View</a>. I&rsquo;m not really sure what to do with that feature anymore.</p>
<p><img src="https://matt.routleynet.org/uploads/2020/2b15519038.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve hidden all of the other screens and rely on the App Library and search to find anything else.</p>
<p>I still like the simplicity behind my earlier approach to the Home Screen. We&rsquo;ll see if that is just what I&rsquo;m used to. This new approach is worth testing out for at least a few weeks.</p>

			 <p>Skipping past the unnecessarily dramatic title, <a href="https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/v7gxy9/the-broken-algorithm-that-poisoned-american-transportation-v27n3">The Broken Algorithm That Poisoned American Transportation</a> does make some useful points. As seems typical though these days, the good points are likely not the ones a quick reader would take away. My guess is most people see the headline and think that transportation demand models (TDMs) are inherently broken. Despite my biases, I don&rsquo;t think this is actually true.</p>
<p>For me, the most important point is about a third of the way through:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>nearly everyone agreed the biggest question is not whether the models can yield better results, but why we rely on them so much in the first place. At the heart of the matter is not a debate about TDMs or modeling in general, but the process for how we decide what our cities should look like.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Models are just a tool for helping guide decisions. Ideally we would use them to compare alternatives and pick a favoured &ldquo;vector&rdquo; of change (rough direction and magnitude). Then with continuous monitoring and refinements throughout the project&rsquo;s lifecycle, we can guide decisions towards favoured outcomes. This is why scenario planning, sensitivity tests, and clear presentation of uncertainty are so important. This point is emphasized later in the article:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>civil engineers doing the modeling tend to downplay the relevance of the precise numbers and speak more broadly about trends over time. Ideally, they argue, policymakers would run the model with varying population forecasts, land use patterns, and employment scenarios to get a range of expectations. Then, they would consider what range of those expectations the project actually works for.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Although I&rsquo;m not a civil engineer, this sounds right to me! I get that people want certainty and precise numbers, I just don&rsquo;t think anyone can provide these things. Major infrastructure projects have inherent risks and uncertainty. We need to acknowledge this and use judgement, along with a willingness to adjust over time. There is no magical crystal ball that can substitute for deliberation. [Me working from home:🧙‍♂️🔮]</p>
<p>Fortunately for the modellers among us, the article does acknowledge that we&rsquo;re getting better:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>As problematic as they have been, the models have gotten smarter. Especially in the last decade or so, more states are working from dynamic travel models that more closely reflect how humans actually behave. They are better at taking into consideration alternate modes of transportation like biking, walking, and public transportation. And, unlike previous versions, they’re able to model how widening one section of road might create bottlenecks in a different section.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But, wait:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Still, experts warn that unless we change the entire decision-making process behind these projects, a better model won’t accomplish anything. The models are typically not even run—and the results presented to the public—until after a state department of transportation has all but settled on a preferred project.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>😔 Maybe it wasn&rsquo;t the model&rsquo;s fault after all.</p>
<p>This brings as back to the earlier point: we should be favouring more sophisticated decision-making processes, not just more sophisticated models.</p>

			 <p>I haven&rsquo;t yet adopted the <a href="https://matt.routleynet.org/2019/06/09/my-iphone-home.html">minimalist style</a> of my iPhone for my iPad. Rather, I&rsquo;ve found that setting up &ldquo;task oriented&rdquo; Shortcuts on my home screen is a good alternative to arranging lots of app icons.</p>
<p>The one I use the most is a &ldquo;Reading&rdquo; Shortcut, since this is my dominant use of the iPad. Nothing particularly fancy. Just a list of potential reading sources and each one starts up a <a href="https://timeryapp.com/">Timery</a> timer, since I like to track how much time I&rsquo;m reading.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s a screenshot of the first few actions:</p>
<p><img src="https://matt.routleynet.org/uploads/2020/0b30d6cbb5.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>I like the bit of whimsy from using emoticons:</p>
<ul>
<li>📚 for <a href="https://www.apple.com/apple-books/">Apple Books</a></li>
<li>💵 for <a href="https://www.economist.com/">The Economist</a></li>
<li>📰 for <a href="https://ranchero.com/netnewswire/">NetNewsWire</a></li>
<li>👓 for <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT200294">Safari Reading List</a></li>
</ul>
<p>A nice feature of using a Shortcut for this is that I can add other actions, such as turning on Do Not Disturb or starting a specific playlist. I can also add and subtract reading sources over time, depending on my current habits. For example, the first one was <a href="https://www.overdrive.com/apps/libby/">Libby</a> for a while, since I was reading lots of library books.</p>
<p>This is another example of how relatively simple Shortcuts can really help optimize how you use your iOS devices.</p>

			 <p>I&rsquo;ve been keeping a &ldquo;director&rsquo;s commentary&rdquo; of my experiences in <a href="https://dayoneapp.com/">Day One</a> since August 2, 2012 (5,882 entries and counting). I&rsquo;ve found this incredibly helpful and really enjoy the &ldquo;On This Day&rdquo; feature that shows all of my past entries on a particular day.</p>
<p>For the past few months, I&rsquo;ve added in a routine based on the &ldquo;5 minute PM&rdquo; <a href="https://dayoneapp.com/2019/09/its-time-for-templates/">template</a> which prompts me to add three things that happened that day and one thing I could have done to make the day better. This is a great point of reflection and will build up a nice library of what I&rsquo;ve been doing over time.</p>
<p>My days seem like such a whirlwind sometimes that I actually have trouble remembering what I did that day. So, my new habit is to scroll through my <a href="https://agenda.community/t/navigating-your-notes/62">Today view in Agenda</a>. This shows me all of my notes from the day&rsquo;s meetings. I&rsquo;ve also created a Shortcut that creates a new note in Agenda with all of my <a href="https://matt.routleynet.org/2019/10/15/task-management-with.html">completed tasks from Reminders</a>. This is a useful reminder of any non-meeting based things I&rsquo;ve done (not everything is a meeting, yet).</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m finding this new routine to be a very helpful part of my daily shutdown routine: I often identify the most important thing to do tomorrow by reviewing what I did today. And starting tomorrow off with my top priority already identified really helps get the day going quickly.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p><a href="https://www.apple.com/watchos/watchos-preview/">watchOS 7</a> has some interesting new features for enhancing and sharing watch faces. After an initial explosion of developing many special purpose watch faces, I&rsquo;ve settled on two: one for work and another for home.</p>
<p>Both watch faces use the Modular design with the date on the top left, time on the top right, and Messages on the bottom right. I like keeping the faces mostly the same for consistency and muscle memory.</p>
<p>My work watch face than adds the <a href="https://flexibits.com/fantastical">Fantastical</a> complication right in the centre, since I often need to know which meeting I&rsquo;m about to be late for. <a href="https://matt.routleynet.org/2019/10/15/task-management-with.html">Reminders</a> is on the bottom left and Mail in the bottom centre. I have this face set to white to not cause too much distraction.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>My home watch face swaps in Now Playing in the centre, since I&rsquo;m often listening to <a href="https://www.apple.com/apple-music/">music</a> or <a href="https://overcast.fm/">podcasts</a>. And I have Activity in the bottom centre. This face is in orange, mostly to distinguish it from the work watch face.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Surprisingly, I&rsquo;ve found this distinction between a work and home watch face even more important in quarantine. Switching from one face to another really helps enforce the transition between work and non-work when everything is all done at home.</p>
<p>The watch face that I&rsquo;d really like to use is the <a href="https://www.apple.com/siri/">Siri</a> watch face. This one is supposed to intelligently expose information based on my habits. Sounds great, but almost never actually works.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>Since I&rsquo;m mostly stuck inside these days, I find I&rsquo;m drinking more tea than usual. So, as a modification of my <a href="https://matt.routleynet.org/2020/01/16/coffee-shortcut.html">brew coffee shortcut</a>, I&rsquo;ve created a brew tea shortcut.</p>
<p>This one is slightly more complicated, since I want to do different things depending on if the tea is caffeinated or not.</p>
<p>We start by making this choice:</p>
<p><img src="https://matt.routleynet.org/uploads/2020/271c3745a3.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>Then, if we choose caffeine, we log this to the <a href="https://www.apple.com/ios/health/">Health app</a>:</p>
<p><img src="https://matt.routleynet.org/uploads/2020/cea879105f.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>Uncaffeinated tea counts as water (at least for me):</p>
<p><img src="https://matt.routleynet.org/uploads/2020/ea0dc7cb48.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>And, then, regardless of the type of tea, we set a timer for 7 minutes:</p>
<p><img src="https://matt.routleynet.org/uploads/2020/d6ce018774.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>Running this one requires more interactions with Siri, since she&rsquo;ll ask which type we want. We can either reply by voice or by pressing the option we want on the screen.</p>

			<h1><a href="https://matt.routleynet.org/2020/04/04/a-simple-shortcut.html">A simple Shortcut for tracking workout time</a></h1>
		

		<a href="https://matt.routleynet.org/2020/04/04/a-simple-shortcut.html" class="u-url"><time class="dt-published" datetime="2020-04-04 11:59:51 -0500">Apr 4, 2020</time></a>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>I&rsquo;ve been tracking my time at work for a while now, with the help of <a href="https://toggl.com/">Toggl</a> and <a href="https://timeryapp.com/">Timery</a>. Now that I&rsquo;m working from home, work and home life are blending together, making it even more useful to track what I&rsquo;m doing.</p>
<p>Physical exercise is essential to my sanity. So, I wanted to integrate my <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT207934">Apple Watch workouts</a> into my time tracking. I thought I&rsquo;d be able to leverage integration with the <a href="https://www.apple.com/ios/health/">Health app</a> through <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT208309">Shortcuts</a> to add in workout times. Turns out you can&rsquo;t access this kind of information and I had to take a more indirect route using the <a href="https://www.macstories.net/news/the-full-list-of-automation-triggers-in-shortcuts-for-ios-13/">Automation features in Shortcuts</a>.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve setup two automations: one for when I start an Apple Watch workout and the other for when I stop the workout:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>The starting automation just starts an entry in Timery:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>The stopping automation, unsurprisingly, stops the running entry:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>As with most of <a href="https://matt.routleynet.org/categories/shortcut/">my Shortcuts</a>, this is a simple one. Developing a portfolio of these simple automations is really helpful for optimizing my processes and freeing up time for my priorities.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Science is built on trust. Trust that your experiments will work. Trust in your collaborators to pull their weight. But most importantly, trust that the data we so painstakingly collect are accurate and as representative of the real world as they can be.
And so when I realized that I could no longer trust the data that I had reported in some of my papers, I did what I think is the only correct course of action. I retracted them.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>I&rsquo;m delivering a seminar on estimating capital costs for large transit projects soon. One of the main concepts that seems to confuse people is inflation (including the non-intuitive terms nominal and real costs). To guide this discussion, I&rsquo;ve pulled <a href="https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/n1/daily-quotidien/191218/dq191218a-eng.htm">data from Statistics Canada</a> on the Consumer Price Index (CPI) to make a few points.</p>
<p>The first point is that, yes, things do cost more than they used to, since prices have consistently increased year over year (this is the <a href="https://www.bankofcanada.ca/core-functions/monetary-policy/">whole point</a> of monetary policy). I&rsquo;m illustrating this with a long-term plot of CPI in Canada from 1914-01-01 to 2019-11-01.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>I added in the images of candy bars to acknowledge my grandmother&rsquo;s observation that, when she was a kid, candy only cost a penny. I also want to make a point that although costs have increased, we also now have a much greater diversity of candy to choose from. There&rsquo;s an important analogy here for estimating the costs of projects, particulary those with a significant portion of machinery or technology assets.</p>
<p>The next point I want to make is that location matters, which I illustrate with a zoomed in look at CPI for Canada, Ontario, and Toronto.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>This shows that over the last five years Toronto has seen higher price increases than the rest of the province and country. This has implications for project costing, since we may need to consider the source of materials and location of the project to choose the most appropriate CPI adjustment.</p>
<p>The last point I want to make is that the type of product also matters. To start, I illustrate this by comparing CPI for apples and alcoholic beverages (why not, there are 330 product types in the data and I have to pick a couple of examples to start).</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>In addition to showing how relative price inflation between products can change over time (the line for apples crosses the one for alcoholic beverages several times), this chart shows how short-term fluctuations in price can also differ. For example, the line for apples fluctuates dramatically within a year (these are monthly values), while alcoholic beverages is very smooth over time.</p>
<p>Once I&rsquo;ve made the point with a simple example, I can then follow up with something more relevant to transit planners by showing how the price of transportation, public transportation, and parking have all changed over time, relative to each other and all-items (the standard indicator).</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>At least half of transit planning seems to actually be about parking, so that parking fees line is particularly relevant.</p>
<p>Making these charts is pretty straightforward, the only real challenge is that the data file is large and unwieldy. The code I used is <a href="https://gist.github.com/mroutley/2e067448ed9315ea8e316cc8486f32fd">here</a>.</p>

			 <p>Podcasts are great. I really enjoy being able to pick and choose interesting conversations from such a broad swath of topics. Somewhere along the way though, I managed to subscribe to way more than I could ever listen to and the unlistened count was inducing anxiety (I know, a real first world problem).</p>

<li><a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b006qykl">In Our Time</a> is another veteran on my list. I really like the three-academics format and Melvyn Bragg is a great moderator. This show has a fascinating diversity of topics in science, history, and literature.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/allsongs/">All Songs Considered</a> has helped me keep up with the latest music and Bob Boilen is a very good interviewer.</li>

<li><a href="https://exponent.fm/">Exponent</a> has really helped me think more clearly about strategy with discussions of tech and society.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.relay.fm/focused">Focused</a> has been a very helpful biweekly reminder to think more carefully about what I&rsquo;m working on and how to optimize my systems.</li>
<li><a href="https://samharris.org/podcast">Making Sense</a> has had reliably interesting discussions from Sam Harris. It just recently went behind a paywall. But I&rsquo;m happy to pay for it, which comes with access to the <a href="https://wakingup.com/">Waking Up app</a>.</li>

<li><a href="https://www.relay.fm/rd">Reconcilable Differences</a> is a bit niche, though I enjoy the dynamics between the hosts.</li>
<li><a href="https://art19.com/shows/sean-carrolls-mindscape">Mindscape</a> has had some of the most interesting episodes of any of my subscriptions in the last several months. There&rsquo;s definitely a bias towards quantum mechanics and physics, but there&rsquo;s nothing wrong with that.</li>

<p>I use <a href="https://overcast.fm">Overcast</a> for listening to these. I&rsquo;ve tried many other apps and this one has the right mix of features and simplicity for me.

			<h1><a href="https://matt.routleynet.org/2019/10/15/task-management-with.html">Task management with MindNode and Agenda</a></h1>
		

		<a href="https://matt.routleynet.org/2019/10/15/task-management-with.html" class="u-url"><time class="dt-published" datetime="2019-10-15 18:38:00 -0500">Oct 15, 2019</time></a>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>For several years now, I&rsquo;ve been a very happy <a href="https://culturedcode.com/things/">Things</a> user for all of my task management. However, recent reflections on the nature of my work have led to some changes. My role now mostly entails tracking a portfolio of projects and making sure that my team has the right resources and clarity of purpose required to deliver them. This means that I&rsquo;m much less involved in daily project management and have a much shorter task list than in the past. Plus, the vast majority of my time in the office is spent in meetings to coordinate with other teams and identify new projects.</p>
<p>As a result, in order to optimize my systems, I&rsquo;ve switched to using a combination of <a href="https://mindnode.com/">MindNode</a> and <a href="https://www.agenda.com/">Agenda</a> for my task managment.</p>
<p>MindNode is an <a href="https://thesweetsetup.com/apps/best-mind-mapping-app/">excellent app for mind mapping</a>. I&rsquo;ve created a mind map that contains all of my work-related projects across my <a href="https://gettingthingsdone.com/2011/01/the-6-horizons-of-focus/">areas of focus</a>. I find this perspective on my projects really helpful when conducting a <a href="https://gettingthingsdone.com/2018/08/episode-43-the-power-of-the-gtd-weekly-review/">weekly review</a>, especially since it gives me a quick sense of how well my projects are balanced across areas. As an example, the screenshot below of my mind map makes it very clear that I&rsquo;m currently very active with Process Improvement, while not at all engaged in Assurance. I know that this is okay for now, but certainly want to keep an eye on this imbalance over time. I also find the visual presentation really helpful for seeing connections across projects.</p>
<p><img src="https://matt.routleynet.org/uploads/2019/1a26935427.png" alt=""></p>
<p>MindNode has many <a href="https://mindnode.com/features">great features</a> that make creating and maintaining mind maps really easy. They look good too, which helps when you spend lots of time looking at them.</p>
<p>Agenda is a time-based note taking app. MacStories has done a <a href="https://www.macstories.net/tag/agenda/">thorough series of reviews</a>, so I won&rsquo;t describe the app in any detail here. There is a bit of a learning curve to get used to the idea of a time-based note, though it fits in really well to my meeting-dominated days and I&rsquo;ve really enjoyed using it.</p>
<p>One point to make about both apps is that they are integrated with the new <a href="https://www.macstories.net/stories/ios-and-ipados-13-the-macstories-review/11/#reminders">iOS Reminders</a> system. The new Reminders is <em>dramatically</em> better than the old one and I&rsquo;ve found it really powerful to have other apps leverage Reminders as a shared task database. I&rsquo;ve also found it to be more than sufficient for the residual tasks that I need to track that aren&rsquo;t in MindNode or Agenda.</p>
<p>I implemented this new approach a month ago and have stuck with it. This is at least three weeks longer than any previous attempt to move away from Things. So, the experiment has been a success. If my circumstances change, I&rsquo;ll happily return to Things. For now, this new approach has worked out very well.</p>

			 <p>Among the <a href="https://www.macstories.net/news/ipados-the-macstories-overview/">many good new features</a> in iPadOS, “<a href="https://www.apple.com/ca/safari/">Desktop Safari</a>” has proven to be surprisingly helpful for my analytical workflows.</p>
<p><a href="https://rstudio.cloud/">RStudio Cloud</a> is a great service that provides a feature-complete version of <a href="https://rstudio.com/">RStudio</a> in a web browser. In previous versions of Safari on iPad, RStudio Cloud was close to unusable, since the keyboard shortcuts didn&rsquo;t work and they&rsquo;re essential for using RStudio. In iPadOS, all of the shortcuts work as expected and RStudio Cloud is completely functional.</p>
<p>Although most of my analytical work will still be on my desktop, having RStudio on my iPad adds a very convenient option. RStudio Cloud also allows you to setup a project with an environment that persists across any device. So, now I can do most of my work at home, then fix a few issues at work, and refine at a coffee shop. Three different devices all using the exact same RStudio project.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>One complexity with an RStudio Cloud setup is <a href="https://github.com/">GitHub</a> access. The usual approach of putting your git credentials in an .REnviron file (or equivalent) is a bad idea on a web service like RStudio Cloud. So, you need to type your git credentials into the console. To avoid having to do this <em>very</em> frequently, follow <a href="https://rstudio.cloud/learn/guide#gitDetails">this advice</a> and type this into the console:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>git config --global credential.helper 'cache --timeout 3600'

			 <p>My goal for the home screen is to stay focused on action by making it easy to quickly capture my intentions and to minimize distractions. With previous setups I often found that I’d unlock the phone, be confronted by a screen full of apps with notification badges, and promptly forget what I had intended to do. So, I’ve reduced my home screen to just two apps.</p>
<p><img src="https://matt.routleynet.org/uploads/2019/f3d75c8fb6.jpg" alt="iPhone home screen"></p>
<p><a href="https://getdrafts.com">Drafts</a> is on the right and is likely my most frequently used app. As the tag line for the app says, this is where text starts. Rather than searching for a specific app, launching it, and then typing, Drafts always opens up to a blank text field. Then I type whatever is on my mind and send it from Drafts to the appropriate app. So, text messages, emails, todos, meeting notes, and random ideas all start in Drafts. Unfortunately my corporate iPhone blocks <a href="https://www.apple.com/icloud/">iCloud Drive</a>, so I can’t use Drafts to share notes across my devices. Anything that I want to keep gets moved into Apple Notes.</p>
<p><a href="https://culturedcode.com/things/">Things</a> is on the left and is currently my favoured todo app. All of my tasks, projects, and areas of focus are in there, tagged by context, and given due dates, if appropriate. If the Things app has a notification badge, then I’ve got work to do today. If you’re keen, The Sweet Setup has a great <a href="https://thesweetsetup.com/things/">course</a> on Things.</p>
<p>A few more notes on my setup:</p>
<ul>
<li>If Drafts isn’t the right place to start, I just pull down from the home screen to activate search and find the right app. I’ve found that the <a href="https://www.imore.com/siri-suggestions-whats-new-ios-12">Siri Suggestions</a> are often what I’m looking for (based on time of day and other context).</li>
<li>Some apps are more important for their output than input. These include <a href="https://flexibits.com/fantastical">calendar</a>, <a href="https://www.meetcarrot.com/weather/">weather</a>, and <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT205773">notes</a>. I’ve set these up as <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT207122">widgets in the Today View</a>. A quick slide to the right reveals these.</li>
<li>I interact with several other apps through notifications, particularly for communication with Messages and Mail. But, I’ve set up VIPs in Mail to reduce these notifications to just the really important people.</li>
</ul>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been using this setup for a few months now and it certainly works for me. Even if this isn&rsquo;t quite right for you, I&rsquo;d encourage you to take a few minutes to really think through how you interact with your phone. I see far too many people with the default settings spending too much time scrolling around on their phones looking for the right app.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>Like many of us, my online presence had become scattered across many sites: Twitter, Instagram, LinkedIn, Tumblr, and a close-to-defunct personal blog. So much of my content has been locked into proprietary services, each of which seemed like a good idea to start with.</p>
<p>Looking back at it now, I&rsquo;m not happy with this and wanted to gather everything back into something that I could control. <a href="https://micro.blog">Micro.blog</a> seems like a great home for this, as well described in <a href="https://www.manton.org/2019/06/02/open-gardens.html">this post from Manton Reece</a> (micro.blog&rsquo;s creator). So, I&rsquo;ve consolidated almost everything <a href="https://matt.routleynet.org">here</a>. All that’s left out is Facebook, which I may just leave alone.</p>
<p>By starting with micro.blog, I can selectively send content to other sites, while everything is still available from one source. I think this is a much better approach and I’m happy to be part of the open indie web again.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>I&rsquo;m very keen on backups. So many important things are digital now and, as a result, ephemeral. Fortunately you can duplicate digital assets, which makes backups helpful for preservation.</p>
<p>I have <a href="https://www.backblaze.com/">Backblaze</a>, <a href="https://www.apple.com/ca/icloud/">iCloud Drive</a>, and <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-ca/HT201250">Time Machine</a> backups. I should be safe. But, I wasn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>Most of my backup strategy was aimed at recovering from catastrophic loss, like a broken hard drive or stolen computer. I wasn&rsquo;t sufficiently prepared for more subtle, corrosive loss of files. As a result, many videos of my kids' early years were lost. This was really hard to take, especially given that I thought I was so prepared with backups.</p>
<p>Fortunately, I found an old Mac Mini in a closet that had most of the missing files! This certainly wasn&rsquo;t part of my backup strategy, but I&rsquo;ll take it.</p>
<p>So, just a friendly reminder to make sure your backups are actually working as you expect. We all know this. But, please check.</p>

			 <p>Good advice from a philosopher on how to disagree constructively:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Many of my best friends think that some of my deeply held beliefs about important issues are obviously false or even nonsense. Sometimes, they tell me so to my face. How can we still be friends? Part of the answer is that these friends and I are philosophers, and philosophers learn how to deal with positions on the edge of sanity.</p>

			 <p>Thanks to generous support, the 4th Axe Pancreatic Cancer fundraiser was a great success. We raised over $32K this year and all funds support the <a href="https://pancreaticcancercanada.ca/research/pancone/">PancOne Network</a>. So far, we&rsquo;ve raised close to $120K in honour of my Mom. Thanks to everyone that has supported this important cause!</p>

&lt;h2&gt;Electoral district names&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One issue with pulling party affiliations from Wikipedia is that candidates are organized by Electoral District &lt;em&gt;names&lt;/em&gt;. But the voting results are organized by Electoral District &lt;em&gt;number&lt;/em&gt;. I couldn’t find an appropriate resource on the Elections Ontario site. Rather, here we pull the names and numbers of the Electoral Districts from the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www3.elections.on.ca/internetapp/FYED_Error.aspx?lang=en-ca&quot;&gt;Find My Electoral District&lt;/a&gt; website. The xpath selector is a bit tricky for this one. The &lt;code&gt;ed_xpath&lt;/code&gt; object below actually pulls content from the drop down list that appears when you choose an Electoral District. One nuisance with these data is that Elections Ontario uses &lt;code&gt;--&lt;/code&gt; in the Electoral District names, instead of the — used on Wikipedia. We use &lt;code&gt;str_replace_all&lt;/code&gt; to fix this below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;r&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;ed_webpage &lt;- &quot;https://www3.elections.on.ca/internetapp/FYED_Error.aspx?lang=en-ca&quot;

To avoid downloading it more than once, we wrap the call in an &lt;code&gt;if&lt;/code&gt; statement that first checks to see if we already have the file. We also rename the file to something more manageable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;r&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;raw_results_file &lt;- &quot;[www.elections.on.ca/content/d...](http://www.elections.on.ca/content/dam/NGW/sitecontent/2017/results/Poll%20by%20Poll%20Results%20-%20Excel.zip)&quot;

zip_file &lt;- &quot;data-raw/Poll%20by%20Poll%20Results%20-%20Excel.zip&quot;
if(file.exists(zip_file)) { # Only download the data once
  # File exists, so nothing to do
}  else {
  download.file(raw_results_file,
                destfile = zip_file)
  unzip(zip_file, exdir=&quot;data-raw&quot;) # Extract the data into data-raw
  file.rename(&quot;data-raw/GE Results - 2014 (unconverted)&quot;, &quot;data-raw/pollresults&quot;)
}&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;## NULL&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now we need to extract the votes out of 107 Excel files. The combination of &lt;code&gt;purrr&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;readxl&lt;/code&gt; packages is great for this. In case we want to filter to just a few of the files (perhaps to target a range of Electoral Districts), we declare a &lt;code&gt;file_pattern&lt;/code&gt;. For now, we just set it to any xls file that ends with three digits preceeded by a “_“.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we read in the Excel files, we clean up lots of blank columns and headers. Then we convert to a long table and drop total and blank rows. Also, rather than try to align the Electoral District name rows with their polls, we use the name of the Excel file to pull out the Electoral District number. Then we join with the &lt;code&gt;electoral_districts&lt;/code&gt; table to pull in the Electoral District names.&lt;/p&gt;

			 <p>The past few years, I&rsquo;ve delivered an <a href="https://github.com/mroutley/analytics_with_r">introduction to using R workshop</a> that relied on manipulating Ministry of Finance <a href="https://www.fin.gov.on.ca/en/economy/demographics/projections/">demographic projections</a>.</p>
<p>Analyzing these data was a great case study for the typical data management process. The data was structured for presentation, rather than analysis. So, there were several header rows, notes at the base of the table, and the data was spread across many worksheets.</p>
<p><img src="https://matt.routleynet.org/uploads/2019/0eb24eda56.png" alt="Finance&rsquo;s table structure"></p>
<p>Sometime recently, the ministry released an update that provides the data in a much better format: one sheet with rows for age and columns for years. Although this is a great improvement, I’ve had to update my <a href="https://github.com/mroutley/analytics_with_r/commit/3ad3aac2ce979405c460acde743500f3203e2067">case study</a>, which makes it actually less useful as a lesson in data manipulation.</p>
<p>Although I&rsquo;ve updated the main branch of the github repository, I&rsquo;ve also created a <a href="https://github.com/mroutley/analytics_with_r/tree/2016_demog/case_study/population">branch</a> that sources the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161014124140/https://www.fin.gov.on.ca/en/economy/demographics/projections/table6.html">archive.org version</a> of the page from October 2016. Now, depending on the audience, I can choose the case study that has the right level of complexity.</p>
<p>Despite briefly causing me some trouble, I think it is great that these data are closer to a good analytical format. Now, if only the ministry could go one more step towards <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tidy_data">tidy data</a> and make my case study completely unecessary.</p>

			 <p>Sometimes it&rsquo;s the small things, accumulated over many days, that make a difference. As a simple example, every day when I leave the office, I message my family to let them know I&rsquo;m leaving and how I&rsquo;m travelling. Relatively easy: just open the Messages app, find the most recent conversation with them, and type in my message.</p>
<p>Using <a href="https://workflow.is">Workflow</a> I can get this down to just a couple of taps on my watch. By choosing the &ldquo;Leaving Work&rdquo; workflow, I get a choice of travelling options:</p>
<p><img src="https://matt.routleynet.org/uploads/2019/a319d3877a.jpg" alt="Leaving work from the Apple Watch"></p>
<p>Choosing one of them creates a text with the right emoticon that is pre-addressed to my family. I hit send and off goes the message.</p>
<p>The workflow itself is straightforward:</p>
<p><img src="https://matt.routleynet.org/uploads/2019/72f7101911.jpg" alt="Leaving work workflow"></p>
<p>Like I said, pretty simple. But saves me close to a minute each and every day.</p>

<p>How in the world did we get to the point that filling out the long form census is just too much to ask?  I frankly cannot remember if I, personally,  have ever had to do the long form.  I’m old enough that I probably did and I hate forms enough that I may have blocked it from memory – but it simply cannot be too great a price to pay for being a Canadian citizen and helping to ensure that all citizens share in its benefits.  And my guess – the majority of Canadians would agree,  even if, like me, they hate the questions.</p>

<p>But we should cut the creationists a little slack, because every new bit of evidence, every discovery, is a nightmare for them. Take the ark. The big-boat business poses all sorts of questions. But, again, they’ve got answers. There are models and plans and layouts of the vessel. You can walk through a part of the hull. There’s biblical carpentry and weather reports. And the dinosaurs are on board. (They were probably small ones, the museum helpfully adds.) But recently scientists found a new giant rat and a fanged frog in Papua, New Guinea, so now some Noah-ists have to redesign the amphibian quarters.</p>

<p>When the Illinois study looked at cases where engineers had taken the time to labor over sophisticated energy models, it found that 75 percent of those buildings fell short of expectations. The fault presumably lay with building managers who made numerous small mistakes—overheating, overcooling, misusing timers, miscalibrating equipment. The buildings’ owners, with LEED banners already hanging in their lobbies, had little incentive to demand better day-to-day performance.</p>

<p>The danger in all this is not just a corruption of science but also an emasculation of politics. The key debates about climate change are political, not scientific. How much resource should we put into mitigating emissions and how much into adapting to a warmer world? How do you deal with the fact that slower economic growth may produce less CO2 but may also make it harder for people in developing countries to climb out of poverty? How do we weigh the moral good of cheaper travel with the moral good of reduced emissions? And so on. These are debates about political principles and ethical values that no amount of scientific data can resolve. The trouble is, the more we insist that ‘the science tells us what to do’, the less we are able to engage in the kinds of debates necessary to resolve such issues.</p>

<p>We like to think that all great events have great causes, and obviously long-term political, economic and military forces shaped the Cold War – and how it ended. But momentous events are also a sort of ambush of history, when all those long-term pressures come together in an unexpected way. The opening of the Berlin Wall, largely unintentional, was such an event, an unsettling thought for those who see history as the result of strategy and planning by pivotal leaders.</p>

Because they’re focused only on “priorities”, and are paying attention only to the most intheir- face stuff, everyone else has to raise the noise level to “emergency” mode to get any audience at all.

<p>I was given an opportunity to propose a measure to clarify how and on what basis the federal government allocates funds to STI - a measure that would strengthen relations between the federal government and the STI community by eliminating misunderstandings and suspicions on this point. In short, my proposal was that Ottawa direct its Science, Technology and Innovation Council to do three things:</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>To provide an up-to-date description of how these allocation decisions have been made in the past;</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>To identify the principles and sources of advice on which such decisions should be based;</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>To recommend the most appropriate structure and process - one characterized by transparency and openness - for making these decisions in the future.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>These are <!-- raw HTML omitted -->reasonable suggestions<!-- raw HTML omitted --> from Preston Manning: be clear about why and how the Federal government funds science and technology.</p>
<p>Of course I may not agree with the actual decisions made through such a process, but at least I would know why the decisions were made. The current process is far too opaque and confused for such critical investment decisions.</p>

<p>Commercial air travel, like many other industries, is lubricated by cheap oil. Mr. Rubin, the former chief economist of CIBC World Markets, has now bet his career on a single idea – that the cheap oil era is dead and globalization is about to wither along with it. But the most fascinating part of his thesis has nothing to do with geology or Hubbert’s peak oil theory. It’s about the reindustrialization of North America. Those unemployed airline workers could be looking for work – and finding it – in the revitalized factories of Southern Ontario.</p>

<p>In finance, you can never reduce risk outright; you can only try to set up a market in which people who don’t want risk sell it to those who do. But in the CDO market, people used the Gaussian copula model to convince themselves they didn’t have any risk at all, when in fact they just didn’t have any risk 99 percent of the time. The other 1 percent of the time they blew up. Those explosions may have been rare, but they could destroy all previous gains, and then some.</p>

A round number, especially a big one, means the government is flying blind.</p>

<p>Physicists and mathematicians often stretch their imaginations by considering what the world would be like if some of their basic assumptions and principles were violated. This has led to new concepts such as non-Euclidean geometry, positrons, antimatter, and antigravity. At the least, violating basic assumptions is a useful mental exercise, but a surprising number of the resulting concepts have provided useful descriptions of the real world.</p>

<p>The Arab states invest their oil fortunes in the craziest things, from the proposed Mile-High Tower in Jiddah to the indoor ski resort in dry-as-dust Dubai. Perhaps the craziest idea yet is Saudi Arabian wheat. Some 30 years ago, the lake- and river-less kingdom decided it should be self-sufficient in wheat.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>It worked. But the subsidies to farmers at times approached $1,000 (U.S.) a tonne. Last year, the Saudis finally concluded that desert wheat made no more sense than Nunavut pineapples. The farms will disappear within a few years, after which the country will be entirely dependent on imports. But from where?</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Answer: from any nation willing to sell or lease vast tracts of its farmland and-here’s the kicker-allow the Saudis to export most or all of the food grown there back home, bypassing the international market. Such “offshore farms” are a quiet, though burgeoning, form of neo-colonialism. And they have the potential to unleash a new food crisis.</p>

<p>No one is suggesting Darwinism has all the answers to social questions. Indeed, with some, such as the role of hierarchies, it suggests there is no definitive answer at all—itself an important conclusion. What is extraordinary, though, is how rarely an evolutionary analysis is part of the process of policymaking. To draw an analogy, it is like trying to fix a car without properly understanding how it works: not impossible, but as likely as not to result in a breakdown or a crash. Perhaps, after a century and a half, it is time not just to recognise but also to understand that human beings are evolved creatures. To know thyself is, after all, the beginning of wisdom.</p>

			 <p>In my investigations of ovule fates, I’ve needed to estimate regression parameters from discontinuous functions. A general term for such estimates is breakpoint regression. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->OFStatisticalEstimates.pdf<!-- raw HTML omitted --> demonstrates an approach using <!-- raw HTML omitted -->R<!-- raw HTML omitted --> for such estimates in the context of seed-ovule ratios.

<p>&lsquo;Things fall not because they are acted upon by some gravitational force, but because a higher intelligence, &lsquo;God’ if you will, is pushing them down,’ said Gabriel Burdett, who holds degrees in education, applied Scripture, and physics from Oral Roberts University…</p>
<p>Some evangelical physicists propose that Intelligent Falling provides an elegant solution to the central problem of modern physics.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Anti-falling physicists have been theorizing for decades about the &lsquo;electromagnetic force,’ the &lsquo;weak nuclear force,’ the &lsquo;strong nuclear force,’ and so-called &lsquo;force of gravity,” Burdett said. &lsquo;And they tilt their findings toward trying to unite them into one force. But readers of the Bible have already known for millennia what this one, unified force is: His name is Jesus.’<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
