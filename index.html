			<h1><a href="https://matt.routleynet.org/2021/12/15/improving-my-running.html">Improving my running with a gait analysis 🏃‍♂️</a></h1>
		

        <a href="https://matt.routleynet.org/2021/12/15/improving-my-running.html" class="u-url"><time class="dt-published" datetime="2021-12-15 16:28:00 -0500">Dec 15, 2021</time></a>

        <div class="e-content">
         	<p>In preparation for <a href="https://matt.routleynet.org/2021/12/14/after-likely-too.html">Tremblant</a>, I had my <a href="https://oneacademylife.com/wellness/">gait analyzed</a> to find out if there are any issues with my running form. I found the process surprisingly thorough and interesting.</p>

<p>Katie (a registered physiotherapist) started out with a general discussion about my running history and goals. Then she filmed me running on a treadmill for about five minutes. We set a fast pace, since that quickly exposes any sloppiness in my running. I have to admit that watching myself running in slow motion was a bit awkward, though my form wasn&rsquo;t as bad as I&rsquo;d imagined.</p>

<p>Katie identified two issues: too much side to side rotation of my arms and a pronounced dip on my left side.</p>

<p>The arms are pretty easy. I just need to be more mindful of how they’re swinging and focus on moving them forwards and backwards, rather than side to side. This better directs my energy towards forward movement.</p>

<p>The dip is more complicated. Katie tried a bunch of different strength tests to isolate the muscle and we found that my left glute was much stronger than my right, which is odd, given I&rsquo;m right handed. To distinguish between strength and muscle activation, Katie tried an acupuncture needle in my right hip. Remarkably, just a couple of minutes later, I was then much stronger on the right side. We did another round on the treadmill and my hips were now nicely aligned.</p>

<p>This suggested to Katie that my strength is fine, rather it&rsquo;s insufficient muscle activation that is leading to the dip. She prescribed some warmup exercises to help. I know that I have a deficient warm up routine (as in there isn&rsquo;t one, I just start running), so this is a good excuse to improve this component of my running routine.</p>

<p>As someone that generally just puts on running shoes and gets going, I&rsquo;m glad I put in some time to understand my gait and identify some opportunities for improvement. I hope to be running for many more years and this should help minimize injuries.</p>

<p>My iPhone Home Screen <a href="https://matt.routleynet.org/2019/06/09/my-iphone-home.html">continues</a> to <a href="https://matt.routleynet.org/2020/09/22/trying-out-a.html">evolve</a> and, now that we have <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT212608">Focus Modes</a>, I’ve made some further adjustments.</p>

<p><img src="https://matt.routleynet.org/uploads/2021/7d1e7a077f.png" alt="Screenshot of three iOS HomeScreens based on Focus Modes" /></p>

<p>From left to right, I’m using three different Focus Modes: Personal, Work, and Fitness. The first two are entirely widget focused, while Fitness has a few app icons as well.</p>

<p>The dock has <a href="https://getdrafts.com/">Drafts</a> which, as the tagline says, is where text starts. This hasn’t changed from <a href="https://matt.routleynet.org/2019/06/09/my-iphone-home.html">my earlier setups</a>. The second icon launches a front-end Shortcut for Apple Notes. As I described in my <a href="https://matt.routleynet.org/2021/11/06/lessons-from-using.html">Apple Note overview</a>, this is an idea that I’ve borrowed from <a href="https://www.matthewcassinelli.com/shortcuts/note-taker/">Matthew Cassinelli</a> and providers a flexible interface to the app.</p>

<h2 id="personal">Personal</h2>

<p>From top left, my Personal Home Screen starts with a stack of Reminders filtered to my Personal list, Fantastical, and Streaks. This is essentially my “what should I be doing” stack.</p>

<p>Next is a stack with Photos and Siri Suggestions. The Photos widget consistently surfaces delightful photos, so I’ve given it a prominent spot. While the usefulness of Siri Suggestions are variable, I like the idea of my phone learning my habits and showing me relevant actions.</p>

<p>Through the middle, I have Weather on the left and the right is a stack of Apple Music and Overcast, which are my options for listening to something.</p>

<p>On the bottom left is a stack of Timery and Screen Time. These are there to keep me mindful of what I’m actually doing, especially on weekends. The Timery widget shows me a summary view of my projects. So, in this screenshot I’ve put in an hour on exercise, another hour on reading, and 20 minutes with some household chores. The Screen Time widget helps keep me honest about how much I’m using my devices, especially on weekends when I really should be looking at something <a href="https://matt.routleynet.org/2020/12/28/year-of-the.html">besides a screen</a>.</p>

<p>And on the bottom right is a stack of Day One and Notes, filtered to my Personal folder. Day One is there for capturing family events and reflections. While the Notes folder often has some useful reference material for our weekend activities.</p>

<h2 id="work">Work</h2>

<p>Curiously, my Work Home Screen is less complicated than my Personal one.</p>

<p>The top is a stack with Fantastical and Mail’s VIP widget. I’m not entirely convinced that the Mail widget is useful here. I almost always just want Fantastical reminding me of my next meeting or task.</p>

<p>Given the more variable number of tasks I tend to be doing while in work mode, I’ve got the Siri Suggestions widget in the middle. I took this screenshot on the weekend, so it isn’t indicative of what it usually shows, which tends to be one of the Shortcuts that I’m often launching to manage my workday.</p>

<p>Intentionally mirroring my Personal HomeScreen, the bottom row is a stack with two Timery widgets and a stack of two Notes widgets, one filtered to my Work folder and the other to my Meetings folder.</p>

<h2 id="fitness">Fitness</h2>

<p>The Fitness Home Screen is mostly an experiment. I spend the vast majority of my time in one of the other two Focus Modes, so I’m not yet convinced that I need any other Home Screens.</p>

<p>Regardless, this one has the Fitness widget at the top for seemingly obvious reasons.</p>

<p>The middle row has the <a href="https://matt.routleynet.org/2021/08/08/readiness-to-train.html">Training Today widget</a> to help keep me honest about rest. And then a cluster of icons on the right. The only one that is non-standard is “Workout mix”, which is just a Shortcut to launch a good playlist in Apple Music.</p>

<p>The bottom row has Carrot Weather to make sure I’m not about to get rained on when heading out for a run. I’ve also added the Batteries widget there to make sure my Apple Watch and AirPods are ready for action.</p>

<hr />

<p>I’ve set up Personal Automations to automatically switch between my Personal and Work Home Screens at 8:45 and 17:30. I’ve found these good reminders to keep my work activities within reasonable office hours. Starting a Workout automatically switches to the Fitness Home Screen.</p>

<p>There’s almost endless scope for fiddling with these. So, by writing them here, I’m adding some accountability to just stop that and use them for a while before making further changes.</p>

        <div class="e-content">
         	<p>Now that I’m <a href="https://matt.routleynet.org/2021/11/06/lessons-from-using.html">committed to using Apple Notes</a>, I wanted a way to download my <a href="https://news.micro.blog/2020/09/29/press-release-microblog.html">Micro.blog Highlights</a> into Notes.</p>

<p>I like using Highlights as a read-it-later service and the highlighting feature is great for quickly blogging excerpts from articles. For longer-term storage, though, and integration with the rest of my notes, it is much better to have the content of the highlights stored within Notes.</p>

<p>So, here’s a Shortcut <a href="https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/d466d38eecb64bc8bbb4516489e2930e">Micro.blog Highlights to Notes</a> that does exactly this. The Shortcut checks first to see if the highlight is already captured in a note to prevent duplication. It also checks to see if there’s already a note for the webpage, just with a different highlight, and appends the highlight to that note, instead of creating a new one.</p>

<p>At least, that’s the idea. I’ve found these checks very unreliable. Sometimes the Shortcut finds the match and appends, and sometimes it doesn’t and creates a new one. Part of the problem seems to be that if there’s any punctuation in the content, the Notes filter fails. For example, searching for “We begin with an obstinate fact:” fails, then remove the “:” and the search work fine. I can use regular expressions to remove all punctuation, but then my notes are all mangled.</p>

<p>After fiddling around with this for a while, I’m just going to move along and assume it is a bug in the Notes actions for Shortcuts. Perhaps not a fair conclusion. The worst case is that I get one note per highlight, rather than just one note per article, and sporadically a note is duplicated. This isn’t so bad, and debugging Shortcuts can be a nuisance. Given this, the Shortcut is likely better used in an empty Notes folder, that is, delete all the previously downloaded Highlights first.</p>

        <div class="e-content">
         	

<p>Back in September, I <a href="https://matt.routleynet.org/2021/09/15/surprising-no-one.html">committed to using Apple Notes for three months</a>. The goal was to focus on my use cases for writing, rather than fiddling with new apps continuously.</p>

<p>Here’s what I’ve identified so far. Many of the approaches and features that I’m using in these use cases are readily available in other apps and often Notes is not the most efficient choice. Now that I’ve documented these use cases, I’d like to use them to assess alternative apps.</p>

<h2 id="meeting-notes">Meeting notes</h2>

<p>Thanks to <a href="https://timeryapp.com/">Timery</a>, I know that 60% of my working time is spent in meeting. So many meetings!</p>

<p>For each one, I create a note to capture ideas, useful information, and tasks. I’ve automated this with a couple of Shortcuts. The one I use the most is “<a href="https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/ec04ef510bc14168bf0394fc083eceb5">Start My Next Meeting</a>”. This presents me with a list of upcoming meetings. I choose from the list and it creates a meeting note, starts a Timery timer, and opens the link to start the video call (typically Teams). The meeting note has the name of the meeting as the title, adds tags for #meeting and the Timery project, adds the date and time of the meeting, a list of attendees, and any notes from the calendar event. From this structure, I can then add notes throughout the meeting and extract any tasks into Reminders later.</p>

<p>I used <a href="https://matt.routleynet.org/2019/10/15/task-management-with.html">Agenda</a> for these sorts of notes before, which was powerful.</p>

<h2 id="daily-summaries">Daily summaries</h2>

<p>Occasionally, I find myself at the end of a week with no clear sense of what I actually accomplished. To help with this, for the past year I’ve been recording the top three things I’ve done in a day into <a href="http://dayoneapp.com/">Day One</a> (the <a href="https://dayoneapp.com/blog/its-time-for-templates">5 Minute PM template</a> has been great for this).</p>

<p>To augment this, I’ve been using another Shortcut to create a <a href="https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/952ca340b26a4c689710b9855d4c0a23">Daily Work Report</a>. This makes a note of the meetings I attended, tasks I completed, and tasks I created. These all get saved to a Daily Notes folder. I then use the day’s work report to pull out the highlights for Day One. There’s some redundancy here, though I find the process of choosing just three things for Day One is helpful.</p>

<p>Overall, I think that Day One is a better app for this use case.</p>

<h2 id="project-notes">Project notes</h2>

<p>For each of my projects, I create a project note that states the purpose or objective of the project, key stakeholders, and timelines. Then I accumulate relevant notes and documents while making progress on the project. Creating these are also done via a <a href="https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/25e882b266dd42c9a2b19933f3b7934a" title="Shortcut">simple Shortcut</a>. I’ve experimented with using checklists for tasks in these notes, but find it isn’t as effective as my approach with <a href="https://matt.routleynet.org/2019/10/15/task-management-with.html">MindNode</a> and Reminders.</p>

<p>Once I finish a project, the associated note gets cleaned up and moved to an Archive folder to keep it out of the way.</p>

<h2 id="research">Research</h2>

<p>This is a rather broad category and, unlike the previous use cases, is for both work and personal notes. Much of this is capturing facts, quotes, and sources. If it is project specific, they go to the project note. Some are more generic and are kept as a standalone note. All of them get tags to help provide some structure. This is where Apple Notes ability to accept almost anything from the share sheet is powerful.</p>

<p>The new <a href="https://www.macstories.net/stories/fast-capture-with-quick-note-for-ipad-and-mac-the-macstories-overview/">Quick Notes feature</a> has been interesting for research. The ability to quickly highlight and then resurrect content on websites is great. I find actually working with the quick notes is pretty clumsy though. They have to stay in the Quick Notes folder and choosing which one to send content to can be tricky. I think there’s some great potential here and will keep experimenting.</p>

<p>For any webpages that I want to archive, I use <a href="https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/7b50dcf65d0e4b08870eb5c3d4efb109">another Shortcut</a> that creates a plain-text note of the webpage along with some metadata and then adds the link to <a href="https://www.pinboard.com/">Pinboard</a>. This has been surprisingly useful for recipes, when all I really want are the ingredients and steps, rather than the long history of the recipe’s development.</p>

<h2 id="other-nice-features">Other nice features</h2>

<p>In addition to these use cases, there are a few nice features of Apple Notes that are worth mentioning.</p>

<ul>
<li>As should be apparent from above, creating useful Shortcuts for Apple Notes is straightforward. In some sense, it is the Shortcuts that I’m finding really useful. Apple Notes is just the final destination for the content.</li>
<li>I’ve set up widgets by focus mode so that the most recent notes are shown on my Home Screen in the right context. These are restricted to a particular folder and sorted by date modified.</li>
<li>The formatting options are comprehensive, including table support.</li>
<li>I think I like the feature where checking off tasks moves them to the bottom of the list. Most of the time, this is what I want.</li>
<li>The iCloud web app is convenient for using notes on my Windows work PC. Unfortunately, I’ve found the syncing to be rather unreliable here, where notes just don’t show up in the web app sometimes.</li>
<li>I don’t share notes as often as I expected. When I do, it works really well.</li>
<li>Not really specific to Apple Notes, but I stole an idea from <a href="https://www.matthewcassinelli.com/shortcuts/note-taker/">Matthew Cassinelli</a> to aggregate all of these Notes Shortcuts into one super Shortcut that creates a list of Shortcuts to choose from.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="challenges">Challenges</h2>

<p>There are a few things that don’t work as well as they should:</p>

<ul>
<li>Searching is too limited. In particular, you can’t narrow searches to particular folders. Most of the time I either only want to search my meeting notes or not include them. I had to set up a <a href="https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/8583784c018b4d5c9df1947e24dfcd01">Shortcut</a> that takes a search term as an input and then asks me to specify which folder to search. This should be built into the app’s search field.</li>
<li>Linking among notes isn’t really supported. You can sort of do this with url searches for note titles. Pretty clunky though.</li>
<li>Given how much I use Shortcuts for Apple Notes, it is frustrating how little you can do when creating a note. In particular, you can’t style text or add tags. Every time I use Shortcuts to create a note, the first thing I have to do is apply title and heading styles and convert any words prefixed with a # into an actual tag.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="other-use-cases">Other use cases</h2>

<p>I’ve found a few use cases that don’t yet fit in with Apple Notes. I’m using <a href="https://getdrafts.com/">Drafts</a> for all of these:</p>

<ul>
<li>Blog posts</li>
<li>Drafting long emails</li>
<li>Capturing and processing transitory texts, which Drafts is really optimized for</li>
</ul>

<hr />

<p>Restricting myself to Apple Notes was a helpful trick for crystallizing my use cases. Now that I’m three months in, I think I’ll stick with Apple Notes for a while longer. I’ve built up a good ecosystem of Shortcuts for working with the app and, of course, now have lots of content in the app.</p>

True, everyone has access to their own little megaphone, and there is endless debate about whether that’s good or bad, but the vast majority of people aren’t reaching a huge audience.

			<h1><a href="https://matt.routleynet.org/2021/10/30/switching-to-icloud.html">Switching to iCloud&#43; Custom Email Domain 📧 </a></h1>
		

        <a href="https://matt.routleynet.org/2021/10/30/switching-to-icloud.html" class="u-url"><time class="dt-published" datetime="2021-10-30 11:32:15 -0500">Oct 30, 2021</time></a>

        <div class="e-content">
         	<p>I&rsquo;ve switched my personal email over to <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-ca/HT212514">Apple&rsquo;s custom email domain with iCloud Mail</a>. A roughly ranked list of reasons for the switch is:</p>

<ol>
<li>One less account to worry about. Not that it was a big deal, but now I don&rsquo;t need to know the various setup details for my personal email. Once I&rsquo;ve logged into my iCloud account, my email is ready.</li>
<li>I appreciate <a href="https://www.apple.com/privacy/">Apple&rsquo;s commitment to privacy</a> and trust that they&rsquo;ll apply this commitment to my email account.</li>
<li>I&rsquo;m already paying for iCloud+ and, so, might as well use this feature and save some money by not paying for separate email hosting.</li>
<li>I&rsquo;m actively using Reminders and Notes in iCloud.com and the Mail interface there is decent, certainly better than the rudimentary one offered by my previous email host.</li>
</ol>

<p>Setup was straightforward with <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-ca/HT212524">clear instructions</a>. Having said that, the only issue I had was that initiating the setup process simply didn&rsquo;t work for a few weeks. I tried a couple of times a week and each time I just got a generic error. Then, for no apparent reason, one day it worked. I suspect this was just an issue with rolling out a new service.</p>

<p>I should point out that my email needs are very basic for this personal account. I don&rsquo;t need many automated rules, tagging, or filtering. So, iCloud Mail is fine. I wouldn&rsquo;t switch over my work account (even if corporate IT would allow it). I get something like 100x the email at work and need more sophisticated tools.</p>

<p>Besides the initial trouble with initiating the setup, everything has been working well for the past week. I&rsquo;m well aware of Apple&rsquo;s well-earned reputation for challenges with internet services and will be staying vigilant for at least the next few weeks. One of the great benefits of having my own domain name is the ease with which I can switch mail hosts.</p>

			<h1><a href="https://matt.routleynet.org/2021/10/10/the-cansim-r.html">The cansim R package is really helpful 📦 📊</a></h1>
		

        <a href="https://matt.routleynet.org/2021/10/10/the-cansim-r.html" class="u-url"><time class="dt-published" datetime="2021-10-10 10:47:00 -0500">Oct 10, 2021</time></a>

        <div class="e-content">
         	<p><a href="https://www.statcan.gc.ca/eng/start">Statistics Canada</a> has a wealth of data that are essential for good public policy. Often a good third of my analytical scripts are devoted to accessing and processing data from the Statistics Canada website, which always seems like a waste of effort and good opportunity for making silly errors. So, I was keen to test out the <a href="https://mountainmath.github.io/cansim/index.html"><code>cansim</code>package</a> for R to see how it might help. The quick answer is &ldquo;very much&rdquo;.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://mountainmath.github.io/cansim/articles/cansim.html">documentation</a> for the <code>cansim</code> package is thorough and doesn&rsquo;t need to be repeated here. I thought it might be useful to illustrate how helpful the package can be by refactoring <a href="https://matt.routleynet.org/2020/01/10/things-cost-more.html">some earlier work</a> that explored consumer price inflation.</p>

<p>These scripts always start off with downloading and extracting the relevant data file:</p>

<pre><code>cpi_url &lt;- &quot;https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/n1/tbl/csv/18100004-eng.zip&quot; # (1)
if(file.exists(&quot;18100004-eng.zip&quot;)) { # (2)
    # Already downloaded
  }  else {
    download.file(cpi_url,
      destfile = &quot;18100004-eng.zip&quot;, 
      quiet = TRUE)
    unzip(&quot;18100004-eng.zip&quot;) # (3)
  }
cpi &lt;- readr::read_csv(&quot;18100004.csv&quot;) # (4)
</code></pre>

<p>A few things to note here:</p>

<ol>
<li>You need to know the url for the data. Sometimes the logic is clear and you can guess, but often that doesn&rsquo;t work and you need to spelunk through the Stats Can website</li>
<li>To avoid downloading the file every time I run the script, there&rsquo;s a test to see if the file already exists</li>
<li>This approach yields lots of files and folders that you need to manage, including making sure they&rsquo;re ignored by version control</li>
<li>Using the great <code>readr</code> package imports the final csv file</li>
</ol>

<p>With <code>cansim</code> all I need to know is the data series number:</p>

<pre><code>cansim_table &lt;- &quot;18-10-0004&quot;
cpi &lt;- cansim::get_cansim(cansim_table)
</code></pre>

<p><code>get_cansim</code>downloads the right file to a temporary directory, extracts the data, and imports it as a <code>tidyverse</code>-compatible data frame.</p>

<p>The <code>get_cansim</code> function has some other nice features. It automatically creates a <code>Date</code> column with the right type, inferred from the standard <code>REF_DATE</code> column. And, it also creates a <code>val_norm</code> column that intelligently converts the <code>VALUE</code> column. For example, converting percentage or thousand-dollar values into standard formats.</p>

<p>The <code>cansim</code> package is a great example of a really helpful utility package that allows me to focus on analysis, rather than fiddling around with data. Definitely worth checking out if you deal with data from Statistics Canada.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>It seems that a 44-year-old French man had gone to hospital complaining of a mild weakness in his left leg. Doctors learned that the patient ‘had a shunt inserted into his head to drain away hydrocephalus – water on the brain – as an infant. The shunt was removed when he was 14.’ When they scanned his brain, they found a huge fluid-filled chamber occupying most of the space in his skull, leaving little more than a thin sheet of actual brain tissue. The patient, a married father of two children, worked as a civil servant apparently leading a normal life, despite having a cranium filled with spinal fluid and very little brain tissue.</p>

         	<p>We celebrated 21 wonderful years of marriage with an extended weekend at the <a href="https://sirsamsinn.com/">Sir Sam’s Inn</a> near Haliburton.</p>

<p>We had gorgeous weather and lots of relaxation.</p>

<p>To burn off some of the delicious food, we hiked up to the top of the ski hill through a twisted, 5K path to get a great view over the lake.</p>

<p>More importantly, we had a chance to reconnect, celebrate our adventures together, and plan for what’s next.</p>

         	<p>Surprising no one here, I&rsquo;ve realized that I spend far more time thinking about systems for my notes than in actually taking notes.</p>

<p>To add some public accountability, I&rsquo;m declaring that for the next 3 months I&rsquo;m only using Apple Notes. This will help me develop a good note taking habit, while also identifying my use cases for later optimization.</p>

<p>Although I&rsquo;ve been thinking about this for a while, the recent <a href="https://thinkingabouttoolsforthought.com/episode-005-interview-with-chris-aldrich/">Tools for Thought interview</a> with <a href="https://micro.blog/AndySylvester">@AndySylvester</a> and <a href="https://micro.blog/Chrisaldrich">@Chrisaldrich</a> really crystalized the idea.</p>

         	<p>A new game on the iPad: try to guess what term Photos is searching for in Spotlight. Here&rsquo;s an example where I&rsquo;m launching Overcast and Photos has used &ldquo;ov&rdquo; to find pictures of ovens. This has actually been a great way to uncover how much more sophisticated Photos has become.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Before you know it, people have starkly different views on the matter, and their views are based on perfectly solid research. The point here is not that we can’t know anything, it’s simply that the world is a complex place, and that the search for simplicity is very often what gets us into trouble. For scholars, the most important thing is to strive to present their work in a way that’s as objective as possible (accuracy), and to present a range of reasonable results wherever possible, giving the fullest possible picture (sincerity).</p>

			<h1><a href="https://matt.routleynet.org/2021/08/08/readiness-to-train.html">Readiness To Train with the Training Today app 🏃‍♂️</a></h1>

        <div class="e-content">
         	<p>I&rsquo;m trying to sequence my workouts in a more systematic way to avoid overtraining. I&rsquo;ve found <a href="https://trainingtodayapp.com/">Training Today</a> really helpful in determining this Readiness To Train (RTT). The app uses data collected by my Apple Watch to provide a straightforward indicator of how ambitious I should be on any particular day.</p>

<p>As an example, here&rsquo;s today&rsquo;s evaluation:</p>

<p><img src="https://matt.routleynet.org/uploads/2021/6c692f0202.jpg" width="300"/></p>

<p>This matches how I feel 🥴. So, today was a good day for some <a href="https://www.litethriive.com">recuperative yoga</a>.</p>

<p>Scrolling back to Thursday, everything looked much better and I put in a good <a href="https://oneacademylife.com/virtual/">HIIT session</a>:</p>

<p><img src="https://matt.routleynet.org/uploads/2021/63f8ca685c.jpg" width="300"/></p>

<p>Of course, the whole point of doing this is to adjust my training to match how my body is recovering. I clearly didn&rsquo;t do this on Friday. Rather than catch up on some sleep, I choose to do a moderate workout and my RTT stayed on the floor. Not great, considering I&rsquo;d signed up for an intense <a href="https://fb.watch/7fVgb-hxZG/">One Academy Endure Challenge</a> on Saturday. I managed to finish, which is the main goal, but it didn&rsquo;t feel good.</p>

<p>Comparing my RTT for this week&rsquo;s Endure Challenge with the last one shows how this indicator can be informative:</p>

<p><img src="https://matt.routleynet.org/uploads/2021/fb7c4f6bf7.jpg" width="300"/></p>

<p>My RTT was much higher back then and I felt really good during the challenge. This gives me comfort that RTT is actually <a href="https://trainingtodayapp.com/blog/how-much-can-i-trust-hrv-are-the-measurements-accurate">measuring something real</a> and actionable.</p>

<p>The Apple Watch screenshots shown above are part of the free version of the Training Today app. The more detailed chart above is included in a one-time in-app purchase. This gets you details like this:</p>

<p><img src="https://matt.routleynet.org/uploads/2021/5ed1731d49.jpg" width="300"/></p>

<p>And a simple widget, shown below on my fitness <a href="https://www.macstories.net/stories/three-weeks-with-ios-and-ipados-15-foundational-updates/">home screen</a>:</p>

<p><img src="https://matt.routleynet.org/uploads/2021/f794576212.jpg" width="300"/></p>

<p>I really like the focussed simplicity of Training Today, along with the straightforward one-time purchase. My Apple Watch is collecting lots of data about me and I&rsquo;m glad I can use it to better manage my fitness.</p>

			<h1><a href="https://matt.routleynet.org/2021/06/08/switching-from-agenda.html">Switching from Agenda to Craft, for now 📅🗒</a></h1>
		

        <a href="https://matt.routleynet.org/2021/06/08/switching-from-agenda.html" class="u-url"><time class="dt-published" datetime="2021-06-08 14:27:22 -0500">Jun 8, 2021</time></a>

        <div class="e-content">
         	<p>In my corner of the internet, there&rsquo;s a well trodden, twisted path of searching for the one true notes app. I&rsquo;ve reached a fork in the path between <a href="https://agenda.com/">Agenda</a> and <a href="https://www.craft.do">Craft</a>. As I <a href="https://matt.routleynet.org/2019/10/15/task-management-with.html">wrote earlier</a>, I&rsquo;ve been using Agenda for a while now and its date-based approach really suits my meeting-dominated work. Now, though, Craft has <a href="https://support.craft.do/hc/en-us/articles/360021080858-Calendar-integration-Daily-Notes">added calendar integration</a> and I&rsquo;m testing it out.</p>

<p>There are several things I really like about Craft, relative to Agenda:</p>

<ol>
<li>Document syncing is far more reliable. This isn&rsquo;t entirely Agenda&rsquo;s fault. I&rsquo;m restricted by corporate policy from using iCloud Documents, so have been using Dropbox sync for Agenda. I often have to wait an indeterminate, though long, time before documents sync across my devices. Craft sync has been instantaneous and very reliable.</li>
<li>Having access to my documents from a web browser is great. I&rsquo;ll be back to working from the office on a Windows laptop soon and won&rsquo;t have access to my iPad. So, web access will be important.</li>
<li>Performance is much better on Craft. Agenda often freezes in the middle of typing and suffers from random crashes. This could very well be something about my particular setup, though it doesn&rsquo;t happen in any other apps.</li>
</ol>

<p>On the downside, I do miss Agenda&rsquo;s simplicity. Craft has lots of ways to organize notes (such as cards and subpages). Of course, you can mostly ignore this, but I like Agenda&rsquo;s well-thought-through approach that didn&rsquo;t require much deliberation about where to put things.</p>

<p>Of course, having just made this switch, Apple announced <a href="https://twitter.com/viticci/status/1402007203435909121?s=21">Quick Notes</a> and I may well be back on Apple Notes in a few months.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>It appears that simple creatures — including, now, the brainless hydra — can sleep. And the intriguing implication of that finding is that sleep’s original role, buried billions of years back in life’s history, may have been very different from the standard human conception of it. If sleep does not require a brain, then it may be a profoundly broader phenomenon than we supposed.</p>

<p>In retrospect, it is obvious that the Gen X obsession with authenticity was anxiety caused by the growing rumblings of a culture in transition. The old technological ecosystem that fuelled the counterculture was gone, but the new web-enabled environment that made authenticity irrelevant hadn’t quite yet arrived. Gen X was the last generation to possess genuine subcultures that were able to remain somewhat unmolested by the digital meat grinder. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Thinking about reincarnation today is, first of all, a reminder of the complexity of Buddhism, and the fact that individual practices can’t be neatly separated from broader institutional histories. Any change in our personal lives is inseparable from change in the world around us. Second, reincarnation offers a way of thinking about the present as connected to the deep past and to any potential futures as well. We needn’t think of the specifics of the reincarnation doctrine to realise that we’re all the inheritors of a past that we didn’t create and the bequeathers of a future we won’t live to see. Third, this temporal relation is also an ethical one, because it suggests that we’re the products of other lives and the creators of other futures, and thus share a global and temporal interdependence. And fourth, it follows that part of our task as humans is to be aware of what we might accidentally replicate from our past and thus unknowingly recreate in the future.</p>

<p>Scientific efforts to shed light on the prehistory of clothes have received an unexpected boost from another line of research, the study of clothing lice, or body lice. These blood-sucking insects make their home mainly on clothes and they evolved from head lice when people began to use clothes on a regular basis. Research teams in Germany and the United States analysed the genomes of head and clothing lice to estimate when the clothing parasites split from the head ones.</p>

<p>So Picard, really, is something I&rsquo;d be judging on two entirely different levels: as a part of an existing Star Trek legacy, but also as a new addition to it. It&rsquo;s a new show, and must be judged on its own merits, but it&rsquo;s also a direct continuation of TNG, and must be judged on that basis, as well.</p>
</blockquote>

        <a href="https://matt.routleynet.org/2021/01/16/choosing-a-podcast.html" class="u-url"><time class="dt-published" datetime="2021-01-16 15:21:56 -0500">Jan 16, 2021</time></a>

        <div class="e-content">
         	<p>There&rsquo;s been a fair bit of <a href="https://micro.blog/SteveSawczyn/10839912">discussion</a> over on Micro.blog about podcast players recently. I&rsquo;ve switched among <a href="https://overcast.fm/">Overcast</a>, <a href="https://castro.fm/">Castro</a>, and <a href="https://apps.apple.com/ca/app/apple-podcasts/id525463029">Apple Podcasts</a> players over the years and, mostly to help myself think it through (again), here are my thoughts.</p>

<p>For me, there are three main criteria: audio quality, episode management, and OS integration. Though, I completely understand that others may have different criteria.</p>

<p>Like most podcast listeners, I listen at high speed, usually around 1.5x, which can distort the audio. Apple Podcasts player is definitely the worst for this criterion. For me, Overcast&rsquo;s smart speed and voice boost features give it the edge over Castro, in terms of audio quality at increased speeds.</p>

<p>Castro is definitely the player of choice if you subscribe to more podcasts than you can listen to. The queue management features in Castro are very good. You can replicate some of this with Overcast, but that isn&rsquo;t one of the app&rsquo;s main features. Apple Podcasts player doesn&rsquo;t offer much in this regard. Despite listing this as a criterion, I&rsquo;ve actually elevated to subscription, rather than episode, triage. I <a href="https://matt.routleynet.org/2019/12/15/declaring-podcasts-bankruptcy.html">carefully curate my list of podcasts</a> and don&rsquo;t add new ones very often. Given this, Overcast&rsquo;s approach is more than sufficient for me.</p>

<p>OS integration is a bit unfair, as Apple has given themselves some nice features that independent app developers aren&rsquo;t able to use. Nonetheless, Apple does a good job of intermixing podcasts and music into their Siri-powered widgets in iOS and the HomePods. With my <a href="https://matt.routleynet.org/2020/12/28/year-of-the.html">reinforced interest</a> in less screen time and use of <a href="https://matt.routleynet.org/2020/09/22/trying-out-a.html">home screen widgets</a>, Apple Podcasts wins out here. This may change once Overcast releases a widget.</p>

<p>As just one example of the integration, here’s what happens when I plug headphones into my iPhone: a selection of music playlists and podcasts appears. I use this feature <em>a lot</em>.</p>

<p><img src="https://matt.routleynet.org/uploads/2021/e24fc8a36f.jpg" width="600" height="600" alt="Screenshot of the iOS audio widget" /></p>

<p>After all that, I&rsquo;m using Apple Podcasts for now, mostly to take advantage of the OS integrations while I&rsquo;m experimenting with a widget-based iPhone. I&rsquo;m quite certain this is short term and that I&rsquo;ll return to Overcast soon. In addition to the better audio quality, Overcast also has some nice refinements, like per subscription speed settings (I like to play music podcasts at 1x) and skip-forward amounts (<a href="https://www.cbc.ca/listen/live-radio/1-51-quirks-and-quarks">Quirks and Quarks</a>, for example, always has a two-minute preamble that I skip). These small refinements are typically what distinguishes the stock Apple apps from good indie apps.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m glad there are so many solid apps for podcast listening. Whatever your preferences, there&rsquo;s sure to be one for you.</p>

My only disappointment was the diminishment of Saru in the last few episodes. The sudden conflict he felt about choosing between Kaminar and the Federation seemed really out of character to me.

        <div class="e-content">
         	<p>Like any 12-year old, my son is pretty keen on gaming. As an all Apple house, his options were a bit constrained. So, we decided to build a PC from components.</p>

<p>I’d last built a PC about 30 years ago, when I wasn’t much older than him. I remember thinking it was cool to be using a machine I’d built myself, plus as a parent it seemed like a good educational experience. I have to admit to being a bit nervous about the whole thing, as there was certainly a scenario in which we spent an entire weekend unsuccessfully trying to get a bunch of malfunctioning components to work.</p>

<p>After much deliberation and analysis, we ordered our parts from <a href="https://www.newegg.ca">Newegg</a> and everything arrived within a couple of weeks.</p>

<p><img src="https://matt.routleynet.org/uploads/2021/fe7be62e0e.jpg" width="600" height="600" alt="" style="height: auto;" class="sunlit_image" /></p>

<p>Following along with <a href="https://youtu.be/npGL2-pRXlU">this great step-by-step video</a>, we assembled the components.</p>

<p><a href="https://matt.routleynet.org/uploads/2021/832ff003e5.jpg"><img src="https://micro.blog/photos/200/https://matt.routleynet.org/uploads/2021/832ff003e5.jpg" width="600" height="600" alt="" style="display: inline-block; max-height: 200px; width: auto; padding: 1px;" class="sunlit_image" /></a><a href="https://matt.routleynet.org/uploads/2021/7750c1f62f.jpg"><img src="https://micro.blog/photos/200/https://matt.routleynet.org/uploads/2021/7750c1f62f.jpg" width="600" height="800" alt="" style="display: inline-block; max-height: 200px; width: auto; padding: 1px;" class="sunlit_image" /></a><a href="https://matt.routleynet.org/uploads/2021/f0aab0b835.jpg"><img src="https://micro.blog/photos/200/https://matt.routleynet.org/uploads/2021/f0aab0b835.jpg" width="600" height="800" alt="" style="display: inline-block; max-height: 200px; width: auto; padding: 1px;" class="sunlit_image" /></a></p>

<p>Given my initial anxiety, I was <em>very</em> relieved when we saw this screen. The BIOS booted up and showed that the RAM, SSD, and other components were all properly connected.</p>

<p><img src="https://matt.routleynet.org/uploads/2021/1bf2fce1a2.jpg" width="600" height="600" alt="" style="height: auto;" class="sunlit_image" /></p>

<p>With that done, we then got to what ended up being the complicated part. Evidently part of the point of a gaming PC is to have lots of fans and lights. None of this was true when I was a kid and there were a daunting number of wires required to power the lights and fans. Sorting this out actually took a fair bit of time. But, eventually success!</p>

<p><img src="https://matt.routleynet.org/uploads/2021/895534abce.jpg" width="600" height="800" alt="" style="height: auto;" class="sunlit_image" /></p>

<p>Then our last challenge, which I likely should have anticipated much sooner. We didn&rsquo;t bother ordering a DVD drive, since everything is online these days. But, our Windows installation showed up as a DVD and we couldn&rsquo;t create any Windows install media on our Apple devices. Fortunately, we checked in with a slightly older kid down the street and he provided us with a USB drive with the right software. With that challenge solved, we finished the project!</p>

<p>Not counting choosing the components online, the whole project took about 5 hours from opening the boxes to booting into Windows for the first time. I&rsquo;d definitely recommend it to anyone that&rsquo;s tempted and technically inclined. My son is quite excited to be using a computer that he built from parts.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The mistake many statistical commentators make is to interpret the p value as attempt at a quantification of evidence, or as a posterior probability. It is none of these things, nor is it meant to be. It should not even, really, be thought of as means to make an inference (although, it is in the most simplistic interpretation of the Neyman-Pearson paradigm). It is, instead, a means to critique a potential inference.</p>

        <div class="e-content">
         	<p>Staying in touch with my team is important. So, I schedule a skip-level meeting with someone on the team each week. These informal conversations are great for getting to know everyone, finding out about new ideas, and learning about recent achievements.</p>

<p>Getting these organized across a couple of dozen people is logistically challenging and I’ve developed a Shortcut to automate most of the process.</p>

<p>Borrowing from <a href="https://heyscottyj.com/2020/05/05/automating-emails-with-data-jar/">Scotty Jackson</a>, I have a base in <a href="https://airtable.com">AirTable</a> with a record for each team member. I use this to store all sorts of useful information about everyone, including when we last had a skip-level meeting. The Shortcut uses this field to pull out team members that I haven&rsquo;t met with in the past four months and then randomizes the list of names. Then it passes each name over to <a href="https://matt.routleynet.org/2020/10/01/supporting-my-favourite.html">Fantastical</a> while also incrementing the date by a week. The end result is a recurring set of weekly meetings, randomized across team members.</p>

<p>The hardest part of the Shortcut development was figuring out how to get the names in a random order. A big thank you to <a href="https://talk.automators.fm/u/sylumer/summary">sylumer</a> in the Automators forum for <a href="https://talk.automators.fm/t/deleting-items-from-data-jar/9620/4?u=mroutley">pointing out</a> that the Files action can randomly sort any list, not just lists of files.</p>

<p>I’m not sharing the Shortcut here, since the implementation is very specific to my needs. Rather, I’m sharing some of the thinking behind the code, since I think that it demonstrates the general utility of something like Shortcuts for managing routine tasks with just a small amount of upfront effort.</p>

         	<p><a href="https://www.relay.fm/20macs">20 Macs for 2020</a> was a fun series and, overall, I agree with the ranking.</p>

<p>Strictly for nostalgic reasons, I would have included the <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/PowerBook_G3">PowerBook G3</a>. This was the first Mac I ever bought and I spent <em>a lot</em> of time with it in the first few years of grad school.</p>

<p>I ran the public beta of Mac OS X which was both incredibly slow and amazingly interesting. My recollection is that I only used <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AppleWorks">AppleWorks</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Audion_(software)">Audion</a>. But, it led to a long interest in and use of open source software like <a href="https://www.r-project.org/">R</a> and <a href="https://www.latex-project.org/">LaTeX</a> that continues to this day.</p>

			<h1><a href="https://matt.routleynet.org/2020/12/28/year-of-the.html">Year of the Tangible</a></h1>
		

        <a href="https://matt.routleynet.org/2020/12/28/year-of-the.html" class="u-url"><time class="dt-published" datetime="2020-12-28 12:12:00 -0500">Dec 28, 2020</time></a>

        <div class="e-content">
         	<p>Inspired by <a href="https://overcast.fm/+E7b4kA8-g">Coretex</a>, I’m declaring <strong>Tangible</strong> as my theme for 2021.</p>

<p>I’ve chosen this theme because I want to spend less time looking at a screen and more time with &ldquo;tangible stuff”. I’m sure that this is a common sentiment and declaring this theme will keep me focused on improvements.</p>

<p>Since working from home with an iPad, I’m averaging about 9 hours a day with an iOS device. This isn’t just a vague estimate; Screen Time gives me to-the-minute tracking of every app I’m actively using.</p>

<p>A generic day is something like:</p>

<ol>
<li><a href="https://www.litethriive.com">Exercise</a> via Zoom in the morning</li>
<li>Meditate with <a href="https://www.wakingup.com/">Waking Up</a> on the iPhone</li>
<li>Read <a href="https://ranchero.com/netnewswire/">news</a> on my iPad while having breakfast</li>
<li>Back and forth between Teams (almost 3 hours a day!) and Outlook on the iPad throughout the work day</li>
<li><a href="https://youtube.com/c/andycrowley">Learning guitar</a> on YouTube and reading books in the iPad in the evening</li>
</ol>

<p>Throw in some Netflix, journaling in <a href="https://dayoneapp.com">DayOne</a>, <a href="https://micro.blog">social networking</a>, and <a href="https://youtube.com/greymatter">random YouTube videos</a> and I’m spending an incredible amount of time looking at a screen.</p>

<p>I’m certainly not a Luddite! The ability of these rectangles of glass to take on so many functions and provide so much meaningful content is astounding. There’s just something unsettling about the dominant role they play.</p>

<p>So, a few things I plan to try:</p>

<ul>
<li>Although I’ll continue reading ebooks, since the convenience is so great, I’ll be rotating paper books into the queue regularly.</li>
<li>I’ve lost my running outdoor routine. Getting that back will be a nice addition to the Zoom classes and add in some very much needed fresh air.</li>
<li>As a family, we’ve been enjoying playing board games on weekends, just not routinely. Making sure we play at least one game a week will be good for all of us.</li>
<li>My son is keen on electronics. We’re going to try assembling a gaming PC for him from components, as well as learn some basic electronics with a breadboard and Arduino.</li>
<li>Our dog will be excited to get out for more regular walks with especially long ones on the weekend.</li>
</ul>

<p>I’ll be adding much of this to <a href="https://apps.apple.com/ca/app/streaks/id963034692">Streaks</a>, an app that I’ve found really helpful for building habits. I&rsquo;ll also add a &ldquo;tangible&rdquo; tag to my <a href="https://apps.apple.com/ca/app/timery-for-toggl/id1425368544">time tracker</a> to quantify the shift.</p>

<p>My hope is that I can find the right balance of screen time and tangible activities with intention.</p>

<p><a href="https://mindnode.com/">MindNode</a> is indispensable to my workflow. My main use for it is in <a href="https://matt.routleynet.org/2019/10/15/task-management-with.html">tracking all of my projects and tasks</a>, supported by MindNode&rsquo;s Reminders integration. I can see all of my projects, grouped by areas of focus, simultaneously which is great for weekly reviews and for prioritizing my work.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve also found it really helpful for sketching out project plans. I can get ideas out of my head easily with quick entry and then drag and drop nodes to explore connections. Seeing connections among items and rearranging them really brings out the critical elements.</p>

<p>MindNode&rsquo;s design is fantastic and the app makes it really easy to apply styles across nodes. The relatively recent addition of tags has been great too. Overall, one of my most used apps.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Waiting pulls us into the present unlike any other experience of time. In the waiting, we realise that this moment is meaningful as it exists, not as some step toward a future moment. Waiting is present tense, and its meanings are full of the potential to transform the ways in which we see the world. Each moment is its own experience and its own fulfilment.</p>

        <div class="e-content">
         	<p>I&rsquo;ve been negligent in supporting some of my favourite apps on the App Store. In many cases, I reviewed the app a few years ago and then never refreshed my ratings. So, I&rsquo;m making a new commitment to updating my reviews for apps by picking at least one each month to refresh.</p>

<p>First up is <a href="https://flexibits.com/">Fantastical</a>. This one took a real hit when they switched to a subscription pricing model. I get the controversy with subscriptions in general. For me, Fantastical has earned a spot on my short list of apps that I support with an ongoing subscription.</p>

<p>And here&rsquo;s my App Store review:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Fantastical is a great app and is definitely one of my top three most-used apps. Well worth the subscription price.</p>

<p>A few favourite features:<br />
- Integration of events and tasks into the calendar view<br />
- Access to event attachments<br />
- Automatic link detection for Teams and Zoom meetings</p>

        <div class="e-content">
         	<p>With the release of iOS 7, I&rsquo;m reconsidering my <a href="https://matt.routleynet.org/2019/06/09/my-iphone-home.html">earlier approach to the Home Screen</a>. So far I&rsquo;m trying out a fully automated first screen that uses the Smart Stack, Siri Suggestions, and Shortcut widgets. These are all automatically populated, based on anticipated use and have been quite prescient.</p>

<p><img src="https://matt.routleynet.org/uploads/2020/72f02dbcc4.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>My second screen is all widgets with views from apps that I want to have always available. Although the dynamic content on the first screen has been really good, I do want some certainty about accessing specific content. This second screen replaces how I was using the <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT207122">Today View</a>. I&rsquo;m not really sure what to do with that feature anymore.</p>

<p><img src="https://matt.routleynet.org/uploads/2020/2b15519038.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve hidden all of the other screens and rely on the App Library and search to find anything else.</p>

<p>I still like the simplicity behind my earlier approach to the Home Screen. We&rsquo;ll see if that is just what I&rsquo;m used to. This new approach is worth testing out for at least a few weeks.</p>

        <div class="e-content">
         	<p>Skipping past the unnecessarily dramatic title, <a href="https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/v7gxy9/the-broken-algorithm-that-poisoned-american-transportation-v27n3">The Broken Algorithm That Poisoned American Transportation</a> does make some useful points. As seems typical though these days, the good points are likely not the ones a quick reader would take away. My guess is most people see the headline and think that transportation demand models (TDMs) are inherently broken. Despite my biases, I don&rsquo;t think this is actually true.</p>

<p>For me, the most important point is about a third of the way through:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>nearly everyone agreed the biggest question is not whether the models can yield better results, but why we rely on them so much in the first place. At the heart of the matter is not a debate about TDMs or modeling in general, but the process for how we decide what our cities should look like.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Models are just a tool for helping guide decisions. Ideally we would use them to compare alternatives and pick a favoured &ldquo;vector&rdquo; of change (rough direction and magnitude). Then with continuous monitoring and refinements throughout the project&rsquo;s lifecycle, we can guide decisions towards favoured outcomes. This is why scenario planning, sensitivity tests, and clear presentation of uncertainty are so important. This point is emphasized later in the article:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>civil engineers doing the modeling tend to downplay the relevance of the precise numbers and speak more broadly about trends over time. Ideally, they argue, policymakers would run the model with varying population forecasts, land use patterns, and employment scenarios to get a range of expectations. Then, they would consider what range of those expectations the project actually works for.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Although I&rsquo;m not a civil engineer, this sounds right to me! I get that people want certainty and precise numbers, I just don&rsquo;t think anyone can provide these things. Major infrastructure projects have inherent risks and uncertainty. We need to acknowledge this and use judgement, along with a willingness to adjust over time. There is no magical crystal ball that can substitute for deliberation. [Me working from home:🧙‍♂️🔮]</p>

<p>Fortunately for the modellers among us, the article does acknowledge that we&rsquo;re getting better:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>As problematic as they have been, the models have gotten smarter. Especially in the last decade or so, more states are working from dynamic travel models that more closely reflect how humans actually behave. They are better at taking into consideration alternate modes of transportation like biking, walking, and public transportation. And, unlike previous versions, they’re able to model how widening one section of road might create bottlenecks in a different section.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>But, wait:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Still, experts warn that unless we change the entire decision-making process behind these projects, a better model won’t accomplish anything. The models are typically not even run—and the results presented to the public—until after a state department of transportation has all but settled on a preferred project.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>😔 Maybe it wasn&rsquo;t the model&rsquo;s fault after all.</p>

<p>This brings as back to the earlier point: we should be favouring more sophisticated decision-making processes, not just more sophisticated models.</p>

         	<p>I haven&rsquo;t yet adopted the <a href="https://matt.routleynet.org/2019/06/09/my-iphone-home.html">minimalist style</a> of my iPhone for my iPad. Rather, I&rsquo;ve found that setting up &ldquo;task oriented&rdquo; Shortcuts on my home screen is a good alternative to arranging lots of app icons.</p>

<p>The one I use the most is a &ldquo;Reading&rdquo; Shortcut, since this is my dominant use of the iPad. Nothing particularly fancy. Just a list of potential reading sources and each one starts up a <a href="https://timeryapp.com/">Timery</a> timer, since I like to track how much time I&rsquo;m reading.</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s a screenshot of the first few actions:</p>

<p><img src="https://matt.routleynet.org/uploads/2020/0b30d6cbb5.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>I like the bit of whimsy from using emoticons:</p>

<ul>
<li>📚 for <a href="https://www.apple.com/apple-books/">Apple Books</a></li>
<li>💵 for <a href="https://www.economist.com/">The Economist</a></li>
<li>📰 for <a href="https://ranchero.com/netnewswire/">NetNewsWire</a></li>
<li>👓 for <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT200294">Safari Reading List</a></li>
</ul>

<p>A nice feature of using a Shortcut for this is that I can add other actions, such as turning on Do Not Disturb or starting a specific playlist. I can also add and subtract reading sources over time, depending on my current habits. For example, the first one was <a href="https://www.overdrive.com/apps/libby/">Libby</a> for a while, since I was reading lots of library books.</p>

<p>This is another example of how relatively simple Shortcuts can really help optimize how you use your iOS devices.</p>

I&rsquo;ve found this incredibly helpful and really enjoy the &ldquo;On This Day&rdquo; feature that shows all of my past entries on a particular day.</p>

<p>For the past few months, I&rsquo;ve added in a routine based on the &ldquo;5 minute PM&rdquo; <a href="https://dayoneapp.com/2019/09/its-time-for-templates/">template</a> which prompts me to add three things that happened that day and one thing I could have done to make the day better. This is a great point of reflection and will build up a nice library of what I&rsquo;ve been doing over time.</p>

<p>My days seem like such a whirlwind sometimes that I actually have trouble remembering what I did that day. So, my new habit is to scroll through my <a href="https://agenda.community/t/navigating-your-notes/62">Today view in Agenda</a>. This shows me all of my notes from the day&rsquo;s meetings. I&rsquo;ve also created a Shortcut that creates a new note in Agenda with all of my <a href="https://matt.routleynet.org/2019/10/15/task-management-with.html">completed tasks from Reminders</a>. This is a useful reminder of any non-meeting based things I&rsquo;ve done (not everything is a meeting, yet).</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m finding this new routine to be a very helpful part of my daily shutdown routine: I often identify the most important thing to do tomorrow by reviewing what I did today. And starting tomorrow off with my top priority already identified really helps get the day going quickly.</p>

			<h1><a href="https://matt.routleynet.org/2020/07/09/different-watch-faces.html">Different watch faces for work and home</a></h1>
		

        <a href="https://matt.routleynet.org/2020/07/09/different-watch-faces.html" class="u-url"><time class="dt-published" datetime="2020-07-09 17:46:00 -0500">Jul 9, 2020</time></a>

        <div class="e-content">
         	<p><a href="https://www.apple.com/watchos/watchos-preview/">watchOS 7</a> has some interesting new features for enhancing and sharing watch faces. After an initial explosion of developing many special purpose watch faces, I&rsquo;ve settled on two: one for work and another for home.</p>

<p>Both watch faces use the Modular design with the date on the top left, time on the top right, and Messages on the bottom right. I like keeping the faces mostly the same for consistency and muscle memory.</p>

<p>My work watch face than adds the <a href="https://flexibits.com/fantastical">Fantastical</a> complication right in the centre, since I often need to know which meeting I&rsquo;m about to be late for. <a href="https://matt.routleynet.org/2019/10/15/task-management-with.html">Reminders</a> is on the bottom left and Mail in the bottom centre. I have this face set to white to not cause too much distraction.</p>

<p><img src="https://matt.routleynet.org/uploads/2020/a6b92b1804.jpg" width="320" /></p>

<p>My home watch face swaps in Now Playing in the centre, since I&rsquo;m often listening to <a href="https://www.apple.com/apple-music/">music</a> or <a href="https://overcast.fm/">podcasts</a>. And I have Activity in the bottom centre. This face is in orange, mostly to distinguish it from the work watch face.</p>

<p><img src="https://matt.routleynet.org/uploads/2020/90daf5286a.jpg" width="320" /></p>

<p>Surprisingly, I&rsquo;ve found this distinction between a work and home watch face even more important in quarantine. Switching from one face to another really helps enforce the transition between work and non-work when everything is all done at home.</p>

<p>The watch face that I&rsquo;d really like to use is the <a href="https://www.apple.com/siri/">Siri</a> watch face. This one is supposed to intelligently expose information based on my habits. Sounds great, but almost never actually works.</p>

         	<p>I&rsquo;m neither an epidemiologist nor a medical doctor. So, no one wants to see my amateur disease modelling.</p>

<p>That said, I&rsquo;ve <a href="https://matt.routleynet.org/2019/05/23/finance-fixed-their.html">complained in the past</a> about Ontario&rsquo;s open data practices. So, I was very impressed with the usefulness of <a href="https://data.ontario.ca/dataset/confirmed-positive-cases-of-covid-19-in-ontario">the data</a> the Province is providing for COVID: a straightforward csv file that is regularly updated from a stable URL.</p>

<p>Using the data is easy. Here&rsquo;s an example of creating a table of daily counts and cumulative totals:</p>

<pre><code class="language-R">data_source &lt;- &quot;[data.ontario.ca/dataset/f...](https://data.ontario.ca/dataset/f4112442-bdc8-45d2-be3c-12efae72fb27/resource/455fd63b-603d-4608-8216-7d8647f43350/download/conposcovidloc.csv)&quot;
covid_data &lt;- read_csv(data_source) %&gt;% 
  select(ACCURATE_EPISODE_DATE) %&gt;% 
  rename(date = ACCURATE_EPISODE_DATE) %&gt;% 
  group_by(date) %&gt;% 
  summarise(daily_count = n()) %&gt;% 
  mutate(cumulative_count = cumsum(daily_count))
</code></pre>

<p>From there we can make some simple plots to get a sense of how the case load is changing.</p>

        <a href="https://matt.routleynet.org/2020/04/10/simple-brew-tea.html" class="u-url"><time class="dt-published" datetime="2020-04-10 13:52:00 -0500">Apr 10, 2020</time></a>

        <div class="e-content">
         	<p>Since I&rsquo;m mostly stuck inside these days, I find I&rsquo;m drinking more tea than usual. So, as a modification of my <a href="https://matt.routleynet.org/2020/01/16/coffee-shortcut.html">brew coffee shortcut</a>, I&rsquo;ve created a brew tea shortcut.</p>

<p>This one is slightly more complicated, since I want to do different things depending on if the tea is caffeinated or not.</p>

<p>We start by making this choice:</p>

<p><img src="https://matt.routleynet.org/uploads/2020/271c3745a3.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>Then, if we choose caffeine, we log this to the <a href="https://www.apple.com/ios/health/">Health app</a>:</p>

<p><img src="https://matt.routleynet.org/uploads/2020/cea879105f.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>Uncaffeinated tea counts as water (at least for me):</p>

<p><img src="https://matt.routleynet.org/uploads/2020/ea0dc7cb48.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>And, then, regardless of the type of tea, we set a timer for 7 minutes:</p>

<p><img src="https://matt.routleynet.org/uploads/2020/d6ce018774.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>Running this one requires more interactions with Siri, since she&rsquo;ll ask which type we want. We can either reply by voice or by pressing the option we want on the screen.</p>

			<h1><a href="https://matt.routleynet.org/2020/04/04/a-simple-shortcut.html">A simple Shortcut for tracking workout time</a></h1>
		

        <a href="https://matt.routleynet.org/2020/04/04/a-simple-shortcut.html" class="u-url"><time class="dt-published" datetime="2020-04-04 11:59:51 -0500">Apr 4, 2020</time></a>

        <div class="e-content">
         	<p>I&rsquo;ve been tracking my time at work for a while now, with the help of <a href="https://toggl.com/">Toggl</a> and <a href="https://timeryapp.com/">Timery</a>. Now that I&rsquo;m working from home, work and home life are blending together, making it even more useful to track what I&rsquo;m doing.</p>

<p>Physical exercise is essential to my sanity. So, I wanted to integrate my <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT207934">Apple Watch workouts</a> into my time tracking. I thought I&rsquo;d be able to leverage integration with the <a href="https://www.apple.com/ios/health/">Health app</a> through <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT208309">Shortcuts</a> to add in workout times. Turns out you can&rsquo;t access this kind of information and I had to take a more indirect route using the <a href="https://www.macstories.net/news/the-full-list-of-automation-triggers-in-shortcuts-for-ios-13/">Automation features in Shortcuts</a>.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve setup two automations: one for when I start an Apple Watch workout and the other for when I stop the workout:</p>

<p><img src="https://matt.routleynet.org/uploads/2020/d11320d29a.jpg" width="333" height="312" alt="" /></p>

<p>The starting automation just starts an entry in Timery:</p>

<p><img src="https://matt.routleynet.org/uploads/2020/198fa31013.jpg" width="333" height="353" alt="" /></p>

<p><img src="https://matt.routleynet.org/uploads/2020/5ee2d63a1c.jpg" width="333" height="143" alt="" /></p>

<p>The stopping automation, unsurprisingly, stops the running entry:</p>

<p><img src="https://matt.routleynet.org/uploads/2020/658efb0e5a.jpg" width="333" height="111" alt="" /></p>

<p>As with most of <a href="https://matt.routleynet.org/categories/shortcut/">my Shortcuts</a>, this is a simple one. Developing a portfolio of these simple automations is really helpful for optimizing my processes and freeing up time for my priorities.</p>

         	<p>As a lapsed academic scientist, I really appreciate the courage that Laskowski shows <a href="https://laskowskilab.faculty.ucdavis.edu/2020/01/29/retractions/">here</a> in both retracting several papers and explaining what went wrong.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Science is built on trust. Trust that your experiments will work. Trust in your collaborators to pull their weight. But most importantly, trust that the data we so painstakingly collect are accurate and as representative of the real world as they can be.
And so when I realized that I could no longer trust the data that I had reported in some of my papers, I did what I think is the only correct course of action. I retracted them.</p>

I use it every morning when I make my coffee. All the shortcut does is set a timer for 60 seconds (my chosen brew time for the Aeropress) and logs 90mg of caffeine into the Health app.</p>

        <div class="e-content">
         	<p>I&rsquo;m delivering a seminar on estimating capital costs for large transit projects soon. One of the main concepts that seems to confuse people is inflation (including the non-intuitive terms nominal and real costs). To guide this discussion, I&rsquo;ve pulled <a href="https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/n1/daily-quotidien/191218/dq191218a-eng.htm">data from Statistics Canada</a> on the Consumer Price Index (CPI) to make a few points.</p>

<p>The first point is that, yes, things do cost more than they used to, since prices have consistently increased year over year (this is the <a href="https://www.bankofcanada.ca/core-functions/monetary-policy/">whole point</a> of monetary policy). I&rsquo;m illustrating this with a long-term plot of CPI in Canada from 1914-01-01 to 2019-11-01.</p>

<p><img src="https://matt.routleynet.org/uploads/2020/deee8a906e.jpg" width="600" alt="Figure showing the long-term increase in CPI from 1914 to 2019. An image of an old fashioned cany bar is on the left and large pile of modern candy on the right." /></p>

<p>I added in the images of candy bars to acknowledge my grandmother&rsquo;s observation that, when she was a kid, candy only cost a penny. I also want to make a point that although costs have increased, we also now have a much greater diversity of candy to choose from. There&rsquo;s an important analogy here for estimating the costs of projects, particulary those with a significant portion of machinery or technology assets.</p>

<p>The next point I want to make is that location matters, which I illustrate with a zoomed in look at CPI for Canada, Ontario, and Toronto.</p>

<p><img src="https://matt.routleynet.org/uploads/2020/601f2db219.png" alt="Figure showing CPI from 2000 to 2019 with separate lines for Toronto, Ontario, and Canada. They mostly align until about 2015, when Ontario starts increasing faster than Canada and Toronto faster than Ontario." /></p>

<p>This shows that over the last five years Toronto has seen higher price increases than the rest of the province and country. This has implications for project costing, since we may need to consider the source of materials and location of the project to choose the most appropriate CPI adjustment.</p>

<p>The last point I want to make is that the type of product also matters. To start, I illustrate this by comparing CPI for apples and alcoholic beverages (why not, there are 330 product types in the data and I have to pick a couple of examples to start).</p>

<p><img src="https://matt.routleynet.org/uploads/2020/0841fc27dd.png" alt="Figure showing CPI from the 1950s with separate lines for apples and alcoholic beverages. Both are relatively flat through the 1950s and 1960s then start to increase rapidly. Apples fluctuate alot in each year." /></p>

<p>In addition to showing how relative price inflation between products can change over time (the line for apples crosses the one for alcoholic beverages several times), this chart shows how short-term fluctuations in price can also differ. For example, the line for apples fluctuates dramatically within a year (these are monthly values), while alcoholic beverages is very smooth over time.</p>

<p>Once I&rsquo;ve made the point with a simple example, I can then follow up with something more relevant to transit planners by showing how the price of transportation, public transportation, and parking have all changed over time, relative to each other and all-items (the standard indicator).</p>

<p><img src="https://matt.routleynet.org/uploads/2020/5b7875e343.png" alt="Figure showing CPI from 2000 to 2019 with separate lines for parking costs, transportation, public transit, and all-items. All-items is the lowest and closely tracked by transportation. Public transportation diverges around 2015 and rises dramatically. Parking fees are by far the highest." /></p>

<p>At least half of transit planning seems to actually be about parking, so that parking fees line is particularly relevant.</p>

<p>Making these charts is pretty straightforward, the only real challenge is that the data file is large and unwieldy. The code I used is <a href="https://gist.github.com/mroutley/2e067448ed9315ea8e316cc8486f32fd">here</a>.</p>

         	<p>Podcasts are great. I really enjoy being able to pick and choose interesting conversations from such a broad swath of topics. Somewhere along the way though, I managed to subscribe to way more than I could ever listen to and the unlistened count was inducing anxiety (I know, a real first world problem).</p>

<p>So, time to start all over again and only subscribe to a chosen few:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.cbc.ca/radio/podcasts/science-and-tech/quirks-quarks/">Quirks &amp; Quarks</a> is the one I&rsquo;ve been subscribed to the longest and is a reliable overview of interesting science stories. I&rsquo;ve been listening to this one for so long that I used to <a href="https://matt.routleynet.org/2005/01/29/quirks-quarks.html">rely on an AppleScript</a> to get episodes into my original scroll wheel iPod, well before podcasts were embraced by Apple.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b006qykl">In Our Time</a> is another veteran on my list. I really like the three-academics format and Melvyn Bragg is a great moderator. This show has a fascinating diversity of topics in science, history, and literature.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/allsongs/">All Songs Considered</a> has helped me keep up with the latest music and Bob Boilen is a very good interviewer.</li>
<li><a href="https://daringfireball.net/thetalkshow/">The Talk Show</a> has kept me up to date on the latest in Apple and related news since at least 2007.</li>
<li><a href="https://exponent.fm/">Exponent</a> has really helped me think more clearly about strategy with discussions of tech and society.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.relay.fm/focused">Focused</a> has been a very helpful biweekly reminder to think more carefully about what I&rsquo;m working on and how to optimize my systems.</li>
<li><a href="https://samharris.org/podcast">Making Sense</a> has had reliably interesting discussions from Sam Harris. It just recently went behind a paywall. But I&rsquo;m happy to pay for it, which comes with access to the <a href="https://wakingup.com/">Waking Up app</a>.</li>
<li>I admire what Jesse Brown has built with <a href="https://www.patreon.com/CANADALAND">CANADALAND</a> and happily support it.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.relay.fm/rd">Reconcilable Differences</a> is a bit niche, though I enjoy the dynamics between the hosts.</li>
<li><a href="https://art19.com/shows/sean-carrolls-mindscape">Mindscape</a> has had some of the most interesting episodes of any of my subscriptions in the last several months. There&rsquo;s definitely a bias towards quantum mechanics and physics, but there&rsquo;s nothing wrong with that.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.relay.fm/liftoff">Liftoff</a> keeps me up to date on space news.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.theincomparable.com/theincomparable/">The Incomparable</a> is great for geek culture.</li>
</ul>

<p>When all together on a list like this, it looks like a lot. Many are biweekly though, so they don&rsquo;t accumulate.</p>

<p>I use <a href="https://overcast.fm">Overcast</a> for listening to these. I&rsquo;ve tried many other apps and this one has the right mix of features and simplicity for me. I also appreciate the freedom of the Apple Watch integration which allows me to leave my phone at home and still have podcasts to listen to.</p>

        <a href="https://matt.routleynet.org/2019/10/15/task-management-with.html" class="u-url"><time class="dt-published" datetime="2019-10-15 18:38:00 -0500">Oct 15, 2019</time></a>

        <div class="e-content">
         	<p>For several years now, I&rsquo;ve been a very happy <a href="https://culturedcode.com/things/">Things</a> user for all of my task management. However, recent reflections on the nature of my work have led to some changes. My role now mostly entails tracking a portfolio of projects and making sure that my team has the right resources and clarity of purpose required to deliver them. This means that I&rsquo;m much less involved in daily project management and have a much shorter task list than in the past. Plus, the vast majority of my time in the office is spent in meetings to coordinate with other teams and identify new projects.</p>

<p>As a result, in order to optimize my systems, I&rsquo;ve switched to using a combination of <a href="https://mindnode.com/">MindNode</a> and <a href="https://www.agenda.com/">Agenda</a> for my task managment.</p>

<p>MindNode is an <a href="https://thesweetsetup.com/apps/best-mind-mapping-app/">excellent app for mind mapping</a>. I&rsquo;ve created a mind map that contains all of my work-related projects across my <a href="https://gettingthingsdone.com/2011/01/the-6-horizons-of-focus/">areas of focus</a>. I find this perspective on my projects really helpful when conducting a <a href="https://gettingthingsdone.com/2018/08/episode-43-the-power-of-the-gtd-weekly-review/">weekly review</a>, especially since it gives me a quick sense of how well my projects are balanced across areas. As an example, the screenshot below of my mind map makes it very clear that I&rsquo;m currently very active with Process Improvement, while not at all engaged in Assurance. I know that this is okay for now, but certainly want to keep an eye on this imbalance over time. I also find the visual presentation really helpful for seeing connections across projects.</p>

<p><img src="https://matt.routleynet.org/uploads/2019/1a26935427.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>MindNode has many <a href="https://mindnode.com/features">great features</a> that make creating and maintaining mind maps really easy. They look good too, which helps when you spend lots of time looking at them.</p>

<p>Agenda is a time-based note taking app. MacStories has done a <a href="https://www.macstories.net/tag/agenda/">thorough series of reviews</a>, so I won&rsquo;t describe the app in any detail here. There is a bit of a learning curve to get used to the idea of a time-based note, though it fits in really well to my meeting-dominated days and I&rsquo;ve really enjoyed using it.</p>

<p>One point to make about both apps is that they are integrated with the new <a href="https://www.macstories.net/stories/ios-and-ipados-13-the-macstories-review/11/#reminders">iOS Reminders</a> system. The new Reminders is <em>dramatically</em> better than the old one and I&rsquo;ve found it really powerful to have other apps leverage Reminders as a shared task database. I&rsquo;ve also found it to be more than sufficient for the residual tasks that I need to track that aren&rsquo;t in MindNode or Agenda.</p>

<p>I implemented this new approach a month ago and have stuck with it. This is at least three weeks longer than any previous attempt to move away from Things. So, the experiment has been a success. If my circumstances change, I&rsquo;ll happily return to Things. For now, this new approach has worked out very well.</p>

         	<p>Among the <a href="https://www.macstories.net/news/ipados-the-macstories-overview/">many good new features</a> in iPadOS, “<a href="https://www.apple.com/ca/safari/">Desktop Safari</a>” has proven to be surprisingly helpful for my analytical workflows.</p>

<p><a href="https://rstudio.cloud/">RStudio Cloud</a> is a great service that provides a feature-complete version of <a href="https://rstudio.com/">RStudio</a> in a web browser. In previous versions of Safari on iPad, RStudio Cloud was close to unusable, since the keyboard shortcuts didn&rsquo;t work and they&rsquo;re essential for using RStudio. In iPadOS, all of the shortcuts work as expected and RStudio Cloud is completely functional.</p>

<p>Although most of my analytical work will still be on my desktop, having RStudio on my iPad adds a very convenient option. RStudio Cloud also allows you to setup a project with an environment that persists across any device. So, now I can do most of my work at home, then fix a few issues at work, and refine at a coffee shop. Three different devices all using the exact same RStudio project.</p>

<p><img src="https://matt.routleynet.org/uploads/2019/f21265f3cd.jpg" width="600" height="220" alt="A screenshot of RStudio Cloud on the iPad" /></p>

<p>One complexity with an RStudio Cloud setup is <a href="https://github.com/">GitHub</a> access. The usual approach of putting your git credentials in an .REnviron file (or equivalent) is a bad idea on a web service like RStudio Cloud. So, you need to type your git credentials into the console. To avoid having to do this <em>very</em> frequently, follow <a href="https://rstudio.cloud/learn/guide#gitDetails">this advice</a> and type this into the console:</p>

<pre><code>git config --global credential.helper 'cache --timeout 3600'
</code></pre>

        <a href="https://matt.routleynet.org/2019/06/09/my-iphone-home.html" class="u-url"><time class="dt-published" datetime="2019-06-09 10:59:00 -0500">Jun 9, 2019</time></a>

        <div class="e-content">
         	<p>My goal for the home screen is to stay focused on action by making it easy to quickly capture my intentions and to minimize distractions. With previous setups I often found that I’d unlock the phone, be confronted by a screen full of apps with notification badges, and promptly forget what I had intended to do. So, I’ve reduced my home screen to just two apps.</p>

<p><img src="https://matt.routleynet.org/uploads/2019/f3d75c8fb6.jpg" alt="iPhone home screen" /></p>

<p><a href="https://getdrafts.com">Drafts</a> is on the right and is likely my most frequently used app. As the tag line for the app says, this is where text starts. Rather than searching for a specific app, launching it, and then typing, Drafts always opens up to a blank text field. Then I type whatever is on my mind and send it from Drafts to the appropriate app. So, text messages, emails, todos, meeting notes, and random ideas all start in Drafts. Unfortunately my corporate iPhone blocks <a href="https://www.apple.com/icloud/">iCloud Drive</a>, so I can’t use Drafts to share notes across my devices. Anything that I want to keep gets moved into Apple Notes.</p>

<p><a href="https://culturedcode.com/things/">Things</a> is on the left and is currently my favoured todo app. All of my tasks, projects, and areas of focus are in there, tagged by context, and given due dates, if appropriate. If the Things app has a notification badge, then I’ve got work to do today. If you’re keen, The Sweet Setup has a great <a href="https://thesweetsetup.com/things/">course</a> on Things.</p>

<p>A few more notes on my setup:</p>

<ul>
<li>If Drafts isn’t the right place to start, I just pull down from the home screen to activate search and find the right app. I’ve found that the <a href="https://www.imore.com/siri-suggestions-whats-new-ios-12">Siri Suggestions</a> are often what I’m looking for (based on time of day and other context).</li>
<li>Some apps are more important for their output than input. These include <a href="https://flexibits.com/fantastical">calendar</a>, <a href="https://www.meetcarrot.com/weather/">weather</a>, and <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT205773">notes</a>. I’ve set these up as <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT207122">widgets in the Today View</a>. A quick slide to the right reveals these.</li>
<li>I interact with several other apps through notifications, particularly for communication with Messages and Mail. But, I’ve set up VIPs in Mail to reduce these notifications to just the really important people.</li>
</ul>

<p>I&rsquo;ve been using this setup for a few months now and it certainly works for me. Even if this isn&rsquo;t quite right for you, I&rsquo;d encourage you to take a few minutes to really think through how you interact with your phone. I see far too many people with the default settings spending too much time scrolling around on their phones looking for the right app.</p>

         	<p>Like many of us, my online presence had become scattered across many sites: Twitter, Instagram, LinkedIn, Tumblr, and a close-to-defunct personal blog. So much of my content has been locked into proprietary services, each of which seemed like a good idea to start with.</p>

<p>Looking back at it now, I&rsquo;m not happy with this and wanted to gather everything back into something that I could control. <a href="https://micro.blog">Micro.blog</a> seems like a great home for this, as well described in <a href="https://www.manton.org/2019/06/02/open-gardens.html">this post from Manton Reece</a> (micro.blog&rsquo;s creator). So, I&rsquo;ve consolidated almost everything <a href="https://matt.routleynet.org">here</a>. All that’s left out is Facebook, which I may just leave alone.</p>

<p>By starting with micro.blog, I can selectively send content to other sites, while everything is still available from one source. I think this is a much better approach and I’m happy to be part of the open indie web again.</p>

        <div class="e-content">
         	<p>I&rsquo;m very keen on backups. So many important things are digital now and, as a result, ephemeral. Fortunately you can duplicate digital assets, which makes backups helpful for preservation.</p>

<p>I have <a href="https://www.backblaze.com/">Backblaze</a>, <a href="https://www.apple.com/ca/icloud/">iCloud Drive</a>, and <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-ca/HT201250">Time Machine</a> backups. I should be safe. But, I wasn&rsquo;t.</p>

<p>Most of my backup strategy was aimed at recovering from catastrophic loss, like a broken hard drive or stolen computer. I wasn&rsquo;t sufficiently prepared for more subtle, corrosive loss of files. As a result, many videos of my kids&rsquo; early years were lost. This was really hard to take, especially given that I thought I was so prepared with backups.</p>

<p>Fortunately, I found an old Mac Mini in a closet that had most of the missing files! This certainly wasn&rsquo;t part of my backup strategy, but I&rsquo;ll take it.</p>

<p>So, just a friendly reminder to make sure your backups are actually working as you expect. We all know this. But, please check.</p>

        <div class="e-content">
         	<p>My <a href="https://www.torqride.com/">favourite spin studio</a> has put on a fitness challenge for 2019. It has many components, one of which is improving your performance by 3% over six weeks. I’ve taken on the challenge and am now worried that I don’t know how reasonable this increase actually is. So, a perfect excuse to extract my metrics and perform some excessive analysis.</p>
<p>We start by importing a CSV file of my stats, taken from Torq’s website. We use <code>readr</code> for this and set the <code>col_types</code> in advance to specify the type for each column, as well as skip some extra columns with <code>col_skip</code>. I find doing this at the same time as the import, rather than later in the process, more direct and efficient. I also like the flexibility of the <code>col_date</code> import, where I can convert the source data (e.g., “Mon 11/02/19 - 6:10 AM”) into a format <a href="https://xkcd.com/1179/">more useful for analysis</a> (e.g., “2019-02-11”).</p>
<p>One last bit of clean up is to specify the instructors that have led 5 or more sessions. Later, we’ll try to identify an instructor-effect on my performance and only 5 of the 10 instructors have sufficient data for such an analysis. The <code>forcats::fct_other</code> function is really handy for this: it collapses several factor levels together into one “Other” level.</p>
<p>Lastly, I set the <code>challenge_start_date</code> variable for use later on.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>col_types = cols(
  Date = col_date(format = "%a %d/%m/%y - %H:%M %p"),
  Ride = col_skip(),
  Instructor = col_character(),
  Spot = col_skip(),
  `Avg RPM` = col_skip(),
  `Max RPM` = col_skip(),
  `Avg Power` = col_double(),
  `Max Power` = col_double(),
  `Total Energy` = col_double(),
  `Dist. (Miles)` = col_skip(),
  Cal. = col_skip(),
  `Class Rank` = col_skip()
)

<p>To start, we just plot the change in average power over time. Given relatively high variability from class to class, we add a smoothed line to show the overall trend. We also mark the point where the challenge starts with a red line.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>ggplot2::ggplot(data, aes(x = Date, y = avg_power)) +
  ggplot2::geom_point() +
  ggplot2::geom_line() +
  geom_smooth(method = "loess") +
  ggplot2::ylab("Average power") +
  ggplot2::geom_vline(xintercept = challenge_start_date, col = "red")</code></pre>
<p><img src="https://matt.routleynet.org/uploads/2019/f229b3bab4.png" width="672" /></p>
<p>Overall, looks like I made some steady progress when I started, plateaued in the Summer (when I didn’t ride as often), and then started a slow, steady increase in the Fall. Unfortunately for me, it also looks like I started to plateau in my improvement just in time for the challenge.</p>
<p>We’ll start a more formal analysis by just testing to see what my average improvement is over time.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>time_model <- lm(avg_power ~ Date, data = data)
summary(time_model)</code></pre>
<pre><code>##

## F-statistic: 46.85 on 1 and 64 DF,  p-value: 3.485e-09</code></pre>
<p>Based on this, we can see that my performance is improving over time and the R<sup>2</sup> is decent. But, interpreting the coefficient for time isn’t entirely intuitive and isn’t really the point of the challenge. The question is: how much higher is my average power during the challenge than before? For that, we’ll set up a “dummy variable” based on the date of the class. Then we use <code>dplyr</code> to group by this variable and estimate the mean of the average power in both time periods.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>data %<>% 
  dplyr::mutate(in_challenge = ifelse(Date > challenge_start_date, 1, 0)) 
(change_in_power <- data %>% 
  dplyr::group_by(in_challenge) %>% 
  dplyr::summarize(mean_avg_power = mean(avg_power)))</code></pre>
<pre><code>## # A tibble: 2 x 2
##   in_challenge mean_avg_power
##          <dbl>          <dbl>
## 1            0           213.
## 2            1           231.</code></pre>
<p>So, I’ve improved from an average power of 213 to 231 for a improvement of 8%. A great relief: I’ve exceeded the target!</p>
<p>Of course, having gone to all of this (excessive?) trouble, now I’m interested in seeing if the instructor leading the class has a significant impact on my results. I certainly feel as if some instructors are harder than others. But, is this supported by my actual results? As always, we start with a plot to get a visual sense of the data.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>ggplot2::ggplot(data, aes(x = Date, y = avg_power)) +
  ggplot2::geom_point() +
  ggplot2::geom_line() +
  ggplot2::geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = FALSE) +
  ggplot2::facet_wrap(~Instructor) +
  ggplot2::ylab("Average power")</code></pre>

<p>There’s a mix of confirmation and rejection of my expectations here:</p>
<ul>
<li>Charlotte got me started and there’s a clear trend of increasing power as I figure out the bikes and gain fitness</li>
<li>George’s class is always fun, but my progress isn’t as high as I’d like (indicated by the shallower slope). This is likely my fault though: George’s rides are almost always Friday morning and I’m often tired by then and don’t push myself as hard as I could</li>
<li>Justine hasn’t led many of my classes, but my two best results are with her. That said, my last two rides with her haven’t been great</li>
<li>Marawan’s classes always feel really tough. He’s great at motivation and I always feel like I’ve pushed really hard in his classes. You can sort of see this with the relatively higher position of the best fit line for his classes. But, I also had one really poor class with him. This seems to coincide with some poor classes with both Tanis and George though. So, I was likely a bit sick then. Also, for Marawan, I’m certain I’ve had more classes with him (each one is memorably challenging), as he’s substituted for other instructors several times. Looks like Torq’s tracker doesn’t adjust the name of the instructor to match this substitution though</li>
<li>Tanis’ classes are usually tough too. She’s relentless about increasing resistance and looks like I was improving well with her</li>

<p>This model has the best explanatory power so far and increases the coefficient for time slightly. This suggests that controlling for instructor improves the time signal. However, when we add in time, none of the individual instructors are significantly different from each other. My interpretation of this is that my overall improvement over time is much more important than which particular instructor is leading the class. Nonetheless, the earlier analysis of the instructors gave me some insights that I can use to maximize the contribution each of them makes to my overall progress. When comparing these models with an ANOVA though, we find that there isn’t a significant difference between them.</p>
<p>The last model to try is to look for a time by instructor interaction.</p>

<p>We can see that there are some significant interactions, meaning that the slope of improvement over time does differ by instructor. Before getting too excited though, an ANOVA shows that this model isn’t any better than the simple model of just time. There’s always a risk with trying to explain main effects (like time) with interactions. The story here is really that we need more data to tease out the impacts of the instructor by time effect.</p>
<p>The last point to make is that we’ve focused so far on the average power, since that’s the metric for this fitness challenge. There could be interesting interactions among average power, maximum power, RPMs, and total energy, each of which is available in these data. I’ll return to that analysis some other time.</p>
<p>In the interests of science, I’ll keep going to these classes, just so we can figure out what impact instructors have on performance. In the meantime, looks like I’ll succeed with at least this component of the fitness challenge and I have the stats to prove it.</p>

         	<p>Good advice from a philosopher on how to disagree constructively:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Many of my best friends think that some of my deeply held beliefs about important issues are obviously false or even nonsense. Sometimes, they tell me so to my face. How can we still be friends? Part of the answer is that these friends and I are philosophers, and philosophers learn how to deal with positions on the edge of sanity.</p>

         	<p>This is a “behind the scenes” elaboration of the geospatial analysis in our <a href="http://www.psephoanalytics.ca/2018/11/reviewing-our-2018-mayoral-race.html">recent post</a> on evaluating our predictions for the 2018 mayoral election in Toronto. This was my first, serious use of the new <a href="https://r-spatial.github.io/sf/"><code>sf</code> package</a> for geospatial analysis. I found the package much easier to use than some of my previous workflows for this sort of analysis, especially given its integration with the <a href="https://www.tidyverse.org/">tidyverse</a>.</p>
<p>We start by downloading the <a href="https://www.toronto.ca/city-government/data-research-maps/open-data/open-data-catalogue/#370e7072-0ba7-e477-121e-78ba5dac9649">shapefile for voting locations</a> from the City of Toronto’s <a href="https://www.toronto.ca/city-government/data-research-maps/open-data/">Open Data portal</a> and reading it with the <code>read_sf</code> function. Then, we pipe it to <code>st_transform</code> to set the appropriate <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Map_projection">projection</a> for the data. In this case, this isn’t strictly necessary, since the shapefile is already in the right projection. But, I tend to do this for all shapefiles to avoid any oddities later.</p>

<p>The file has 1700 rows of data across 14 columns. The first 13 columns are data within the original shapefile. The last column is a <a href="https://www.rstudio.com/resources/videos/how-to-work-with-list-columns/">list column</a> that is added by <code>sf</code> and contains the geometry of the location. This specific design feature is what makes an <code>sf</code> object work really well with the rest of the tidyverse: the geographical details are just a column in the data frame. This makes the data much easier to work with than in other approaches, where the data is contained within an <code>@data</code> slot of an object.</p>
<p>Plotting the data is straightforward, since <code>sf</code> objects have a <code>plot</code> function. Here’s an example where we plot the number of voters (<code>VOTER_CNT</code>) at each location. If you squint just right, you can see the general outline of Toronto in these points.</p>
<p><img src="https://matt.routleynet.org/uploads/2019/c1f3d1400b.png" width="672" /></p>
<p>What we want to do next is use the voting location data to aggregate the votes cast at each location into census tracts. This then allows us to associate census characteristics (like age and income) with the pattern of votes and develop our statistical relationships for predicting voter behaviour.</p>
<p>We’ll split this into several steps. The first is downloading and reading the census tract shapefile.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>download.file("[www12.statcan.gc.ca/census-re...](http://www12.statcan.gc.ca/census-recensement/2011/geo/bound-limit/files-fichiers/gct_000b11a_e.zip)",
                destfile = "data-raw/gct_000b11a_e.zip", quiet = TRUE)
unzip("data-raw/gct_000b11a_e.zip", exdir="data-raw/gct")
census_tracts <- sf::read_sf("data-raw/gct", layer = "gct_000b11a_e") %>%
  sf::st_transform(crs = "+init=epsg:4326")</code></pre>
<p>Now that we have it, all we really want are the census tracts in Toronto (the shapefile includes census tracts across Canada). We achieve this by intersecting the Toronto voting locations with the census tracts using standard R subsetting notation.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>to_census_tracts <- census_tracts[toronto_locations,]</code></pre>
<p>And, we can plot it to see how well the intersection worked. This time we’ll plot the CTUID, which is the unique identifier for each census tract. This doesn’t mean anything in this context, but adds some nice colour to the plot.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>plot(to_census_tracts["CTUID"])</code></pre>
<p><img src="https://matt.routleynet.org/uploads/2019/22d42cb3c3.png" width="672" /></p>
<p>Now you can really see the shape of Toronto, as well as the size of each census tract.</p>
<p>Next we need to manipulate the voting data to get votes received by major candidates in the 2018 election. We take these data from the <a href="https://github.com/Psepho/toVotes"><code>toVotes</code> package</a> and arbitrarily set the threshold for major candidates to receiving at least 100,000 votes. This yields our two main candidates: John Tory and Jennifer Keesmaat.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>major_candidates <- toVotes %>% 
  dplyr::filter(year == 2018) %>%
  dplyr::group_by(candidate) %>%
  dplyr::summarise(votes = sum(votes)) %>%
  dplyr::filter(votes > 100000) %>%
  dplyr::select(candidate)
major_candidates</code></pre>
<pre><code>## # A tibble: 2 x 1
##   candidate        
##   <chr>            
## 1 Keesmaat Jennifer
## 2 Tory John</code></pre>
<p>Given our goal of aggregating the votes received by each candidate into census tracts, we need a data frame that has each candidate in a separate column. We start by joining the major candidates table to the votes table. In this case, we also filter the votes to 2018, since John Tory has been a candidate in more than one election. Then we use the <code>tidyr</code> package to convert the table from long (with one candidate column) to wide (with a column for each candidate).</p>
<pre class="r"><code>spread_votes <- toVotes %>%
  tibble::as.tibble() %>% 
  dplyr::filter(year == 2018) %>%
  dplyr::right_join(major_candidates) %>%
  dplyr::select(-type, -year) %>%
  tidyr::spread(candidate, votes)
spread_votes</code></pre>
<pre><code>## # A tibble: 1,800 x 4

## # ... with 1,790 more rows</code></pre>
<p>Our last step before finally aggregating to census tracts is to join the <code>spread_votes</code> table with the <code>toronto_locations</code> data. This requires pulling the ward and area identifiers from the <code>PT_LNG_CD</code> column of the <code>toronto_locations</code> data frame which we do with some <code>stringr</code> functions. While we’re at it, we also update the candidate names to just surnames.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>to_geo_votes <- toronto_locations %>%
  dplyr::mutate(ward = as.integer(stringr::str_sub(PT_LNG_CD, 1, 2)),
                area = as.integer(stringr::str_sub(PT_LNG_CD, -3, -1))) %>%
  dplyr::left_join(spread_votes) %>%
  dplyr::select(`Keesmaat Jennifer`, `Tory John`) %>%

<p>Okay, we’re finally there. We have our census tract data in <code>to_census_tracts</code> and our voting data in <code>to_geo_votes</code>.

<p>Now that we have votes aggregated by census tract, we can add in many other attributes from the census data. We won’t do that here, since this post is already pretty long. But, we’ll end with a plot to show how easily <code>sf</code> integrates with <code>ggplot2</code>. This is a nice improvement from past workflows, when several steps were required. In the actual <a href="https://github.com/Psepho/to2018retrospective/blob/master/compare_pred_actual_2018.Rmd">code for the retrospective analysis</a>, I added some other plotting techniques, like cutting the response variable (votes) into equally spaced pieces and adding some more refined labels. Here, we’ll just produce a simple plot.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>ggplot2::ggplot(data = ct_votes) +
  ggplot2::geom_sf(ggplot2::aes(fill = votes)) +
  ggplot2::facet_wrap(~candidate)</code></pre>

        <a href="https://matt.routleynet.org/2019/05/23/fixing-a-hack.html" class="u-url"><time class="dt-published" datetime="2018-09-02 14:20:00 -0500">Sep 2, 2018</time></a>

        <div class="e-content">
         	<p>In my <a href="https://matt.routleynet.org/2019/05/23/elections-ontario-official.html">Elections Ontario official results</a> post, I had to use an ugly hack to match Electoral District names and numbers by extracting data from a drop down list on the Find My Electoral District website. Although it was mildly clever, like any hack, I shouldn’t have relied on this one for long, as proven by Elections Ontario shutting down the website.</p>
<p>So, a more robust solution was required, which led to using one of Election Ontario’s shapefiles. The shapefile contains the data we need, it’s just in a tricky format to deal with. But, the <code>sf</code> package makes this mostly straightforward.</p>
<p>We start by downloading and importing the Elections Ontario shape file. Then, since we’re only interested in the City of Toronto boundaries, we download the city’s shapefile too and intersect it with the provincial one to get a subset:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>download.file("[www.elections.on.ca/content/d...](https://www.elections.on.ca/content/dam/NGW/sitecontent/2016/preo/shapefiles/Polling%20Division%20Shapefile%20-%202014%20General%20Election.zip)", 
              destfile = "data-raw/Polling%20Division%20Shapefile%20-%202014%20General%20Election.zip")
unzip("data-raw/Polling%20Division%20Shapefile%20-%202014%20General%20Election.zip", 
      exdir = "data-raw/Polling%20Division%20Shapefile%20-%202014%20General%20Election")

prov_geo <- sf::st_read("data-raw/Polling%20Division%20Shapefile%20-%202014%20General%20Election", 
                        layer = "PDs_Ontario") %>%
  sf::st_transform(crs = "+init=epsg:4326")

download.file("[opendata.toronto.ca/gcc/votin...](http://opendata.toronto.ca/gcc/voting_location_2014_wgs84.zip)",
              destfile = "data-raw/voting_location_2014_wgs84.zip")
unzip("data-raw/voting_location_2014_wgs84.zip", exdir="data-raw/voting_location_2014_wgs84")
toronto_wards <- sf::st_read("data-raw/voting_location_2014_wgs84", layer = "VOTING_LOCATION_2014_WGS84") %>%
  sf::st_transform(crs = "+init=epsg:4326")

to_prov_geo <- prov_geo %>%
  sf::st_intersection(toronto_wards)</code></pre>
<p>Now we just need to extract a couple of columns from the data frame associated with the shapefile. Then we process the values a bit so that they match the format of other data sets. This includes converting them to UTF-8, formatting as title case, and replacing dashes with spaces:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>electoral_districts <- to_prov_geo %>%
  dplyr::transmute(electoral_district = as.character(DATA_COMPI),
                   electoral_district_name = stringr::str_to_title(KPI04)) %>%
  dplyr::group_by(electoral_district, electoral_district_name) %>%
  dplyr::count() %>%
  dplyr::ungroup() %>%
  dplyr::mutate(electoral_district_name = stringr::str_replace_all(utf8::as_utf8(electoral_district_name), "\u0097", " ")) %>%
  dplyr::select(electoral_district, electoral_district_name)
electoral_districts</code></pre>

        <div class="e-content">
         	<p>In preparing for some <a href="http://www.psephoanalytics.ca/">PsephoAnalytics</a> work on the upcoming provincial election, I’ve been wrangling the <a href="http://www.elections.on.ca/en/resource-centre/elections-results.html">Elections Ontario</a> data. As provided, the data is really difficult to work with and we’ll walk through some steps to tidy these data for later analysis.</p>
<p>Here’s what the source data looks like:</p>
<div class="figure">
<img src="https://matt.routleynet.org/uploads/2019/90081f2261.png" alt="Screenshot of raw Elections Ontario data" />
<p class="caption">Screenshot of raw Elections Ontario data</p>
</div>
<p>A few problems with this:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>The data is scattered across a hundred different Excel files</li>
<li>Candidates are in columns with their last name as the header</li>
<li>Last names are not unique across all Electoral Districts, so can’t be used as a unique identifier</li>
<li>Electoral District names are in a row, followed by a separate row for each poll within the district</li>
<li>The party affiliation for each candidate isn’t included in the data</li>
</ol>
<p>So, we have a fair bit of work to do to get to something more useful. Ideally something like:</p>

<pre><code>## # A tibble: 9 x 5
##   electoral_district  poll candidate   party votes
##                &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt;     &lt;chr&gt;   &lt;chr&gt; &lt;int&gt;
## 1                  X     1         A Liberal    37
## 2                  X     2         B     NDP    45
## 3                  X     3         C      PC    33
## 4                  Y     1         A Liberal    71
## 5                  Y     2         B     NDP    37
## 6                  Y     3         C      PC    69
## 7                  Z     1         A Liberal    28
## 8                  Z     2         B     NDP    15
## 9                  Z     3         C      PC    34
</code></pre>

<p><p>This is much easier to work with: we have one row for the votes received by each candidate at each poll, along with the Electoral District name and their party affiliation.</p>
<div id="candidate-parties" class="section level2">
<h2>Candidate parties</h2>
<p>As a first step, we need the party affiliation for each candidate. I didn’t see this information on the Elections Ontario site. So, we’ll pull the data from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ontario_general_election,_2014#Candidates_by_region">Wikipedia</a>. The data on this webpage isn’t too bad. We can just use the <code>table</code> xpath selector to pull out the tables and then drop the ones we aren’t interested in.</p>
<pre class="r"></p>

<pre><code>candidate_webpage &lt;- &quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ontario_general_election,_2014#Candidates_by_region&quot;
candidate_tables &lt;- &quot;table&quot; # Use an xpath selector to get the drop down list by ID

candidates &lt;- xml2::read_html(candidate_webpage) %&gt;%
  rvest::html_nodes(candidate_tables) %&gt;% # Pull tables from the wikipedia entry
  .[13:25] %&gt;% # Drop unecessary tables
  rvest::html_table(fill = TRUE)
</code></pre>

<p></pre>
<p>This gives us a list of 13 data frames, one for each table on the webpage. Now we cycle through each of these and stack them into one data frame. Unfortunately, the tables aren’t consistent in the number of columns. So, the approach is a bit messy and we process each one in a loop.</p>
<pre class="r"><code># Setup empty dataframe to store results
candidate_parties &lt;- tibble::as_tibble(
  electoral_district_name = NULL,
  party = NULL,
  candidate = NULL
)</p>

<p>for(i in seq_along(1:length(candidates))) { # Messy, but works
  this_table &lt;- candidates[[i]]
  # The header spans mess up the header row, so renaming
  names(this_table) &lt;- c(this_table[1,-c(3,4)], &ldquo;NA&rdquo;, &ldquo;Incumbent&rdquo;)
  # Get rid of the blank spacer columns
  this_table &lt;- this_table[-1, ]
  # Drop the NA columns by keeping only odd columns
  this_table &lt;- this_table[,seq(from = 1, to = dim(this_table)[2], by = 2)]
  this_table %&lt;&gt;%
    tidyr::gather(party, candidate, -<code>Electoral District</code>) %&gt;%
    dplyr::rename(electoral_district_name = <code>Electoral District</code>) %&gt;%

}

<div id="electoral-district-names" class="section level2">
<h2>Electoral district names</h2>
<p>One issue with pulling party affiliations from Wikipedia is that candidates are organized by Electoral District <em>names</em>. But the voting results are organized by Electoral District <em>number</em>. I couldn’t find an appropriate resource on the Elections Ontario site. Rather, here we pull the names and numbers of the Electoral Districts from the <a href="https://www3.elections.on.ca/internetapp/FYED_Error.aspx?lang=en-ca">Find My Electoral District</a> website. The xpath selector is a bit tricky for this one. The <code>ed_xpath</code> object below actually pulls content from the drop down list that appears when you choose an Electoral District. One nuisance with these data is that Elections Ontario uses <code>&ndash;</code> in the Electoral District names, instead of the — used on Wikipedia. We use <code>str_replace_all</code> to fix this below.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>ed_webpage &lt;- &ldquo;<a href="https://www3.elections.on.ca/internetapp/FYED_Error.aspx?lang=en-ca&quot;">https://www3.elections.on.ca/internetapp/FYED_Error.aspx?lang=en-ca&quot;</a>

<p>All that work just to get the name of each candiate for each Electoral District name and number, plus their party affiliation.</p>
</div>
<div id="votes" class="section level2">
<h2>Votes</h2>
<p>Now we can finally get to the actual voting data. These are made available as a collection of Excel files in a compressed folder. To avoid downloading it more than once, we wrap the call in an <code>if</code> statement that first checks to see if we already have the file. We also rename the file to something more manageable.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>raw_results_file &lt;- &ldquo;<a href="http://www.elections.on.ca/content/dam/NGW/sitecontent/2017/results/Poll%20by%20Poll%20Results%20-%20Excel.zip">www.elections.on.ca/content/d&hellip;</a>&ldquo;</p>

<p>zip_file &lt;- &ldquo;data-raw/Poll%20by%20Poll%20Results%20-%20Excel.zip&rdquo;
if(file.exists(zip_file)) { # Only download the data once
  # File exists, so nothing to do
}  else {
  download.file(raw_results_file,
                destfile = zip_file)
  unzip(zip_file, exdir=&ldquo;data-raw&rdquo;) # Extract the data into data-raw
  file.rename(&ldquo;data-raw/GE Results - 2014 (unconverted)&rdquo;, &ldquo;data-raw/pollresults&rdquo;)
}</code></pre>
<pre><code>## NULL</code></pre>
<p>Now we need to extract the votes out of 107 Excel files. The combination of <code>purrr</code> and <code>readxl</code> packages is great for this. In case we want to filter to just a few of the files (perhaps to target a range of Electoral Districts), we declare a <code>file_pattern</code>. For now, we just set it to any xls file that ends with three digits preceeded by a “_“.</p>
<p>As we read in the Excel files, we clean up lots of blank columns and headers. Then we convert to a long table and drop total and blank rows. Also, rather than try to align the Electoral District name rows with their polls, we use the name of the Excel file to pull out the Electoral District number. Then we join with the <code>electoral_districts</code> table to pull in the Electoral District names.</p>
<pre class="r"></p>

<pre><code>file_pattern &lt;- &quot;*_[[:digit:]]{3}.xls&quot; # Can use this to filter down to specific files
poll_data &lt;- list.files(path = &quot;data-raw/pollresults&quot;, pattern = file_pattern, full.names = TRUE) %&gt;% # Find all files that match the pattern
  purrr::set_names() %&gt;%
  purrr::map_df(readxl::read_excel, sheet = 1, col_types = &quot;text&quot;, .id = &quot;file&quot;) %&gt;%   # Import each file and merge into a dataframe
  # Specifying sheet = 1 just to be clear we're ignoring the rest of the sheets
  # Declare col_types since there are duplicate surnames and map_df can't recast column types in the rbind
  # For example, Bell is in both district 014 and 063
  dplyr::select(-starts_with(&quot;X__&quot;)) %&gt;% # Drop all of the blank columns
  dplyr::select(1:2,4:8,15:dim(.)[2]) %&gt;% # Reorganize a bit and drop unneeded columns
  dplyr::rename(poll_number = `POLL NO.`) %&gt;%
  tidyr::gather(candidate, votes, -file, -poll_number) %&gt;% # Convert to a long table
  dplyr::filter(!is.na(votes),
                poll_number != &quot;Totals&quot;) %&gt;%
  dplyr::mutate(electoral_district = stringr::str_extract(file, &quot;[[:digit:]]{3}&quot;),

        <div class="e-content">
         	<p>The past few years, I&rsquo;ve delivered an <a href="https://github.com/mroutley/analytics_with_r">introduction to using R workshop</a> that relied on manipulating Ministry of Finance <a href="https://www.fin.gov.on.ca/en/economy/demographics/projections/">demographic projections</a>.</p>

<p>Analyzing these data was a great case study for the typical data management process. The data was structured for presentation, rather than analysis. So, there were several header rows, notes at the base of the table, and the data was spread across many worksheets.</p>

<p><img src="https://matt.routleynet.org/uploads/2019/0eb24eda56.png" alt="Finance's table structure" /></p>

<p>Sometime recently, the ministry released an update that provides the data in a much better format: one sheet with rows for age and columns for years. Although this is a great improvement, I’ve had to update my <a href="https://github.com/mroutley/analytics_with_r/commit/3ad3aac2ce979405c460acde743500f3203e2067">case study</a>, which makes it actually less useful as a lesson in data manipulation.</p>

<p>Although I&rsquo;ve updated the main branch of the github repository, I&rsquo;ve also created a <a href="https://github.com/mroutley/analytics_with_r/tree/2016_demog/case_study/population">branch</a> that sources the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161014124140/https://www.fin.gov.on.ca/en/economy/demographics/projections/table6.html">archive.org version</a> of the page from October 2016. Now, depending on the audience, I can choose the case study that has the right level of complexity.</p>

<p>Despite briefly causing me some trouble, I think it is great that these data are closer to a good analytical format. Now, if only the ministry could go one more step towards <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tidy_data">tidy data</a> and make my case study completely unecessary.</p>

         	<p>Sometimes it&rsquo;s the small things, accumulated over many days, that make a difference. As a simple example, every day when I leave the office, I message my family to let them know I&rsquo;m leaving and how I&rsquo;m travelling. Relatively easy: just open the Messages app, find the most recent conversation with them, and type in my message.</p>

<p>Using <a href="https://workflow.is">Workflow</a> I can get this down to just a couple of taps on my watch. By choosing the &ldquo;Leaving Work&rdquo; workflow, I get a choice of travelling options:</p>

<p><img src="https://matt.routleynet.org/uploads/2019/a319d3877a.jpg" alt="Leaving work from the Apple Watch" /></p>

<p>Choosing one of them creates a text with the right emoticon that is pre-addressed to my family. I hit send and off goes the message.</p>

<p>The workflow itself is straightforward:</p>

<p><img src="https://matt.routleynet.org/uploads/2019/72f7101911.jpg" alt="Leaving work workflow" /></p>

<p>Like I said, pretty simple. But saves me close to a minute each and every day.</p>

<p>Many people took issue with the fact that these values weren’t adjusted for income. Seems to me that whether this is a good idea or not depends on what kind of question you’re trying to answer. Regardless, the <a href="http://www5.statcan.gc.ca/cansim/a26?lang=eng&retrLang=eng&id=1110001">CANSIM</a> table includes this value. So, it is straightforward to calculate. Plus CANSIM tables have a pretty standard structure and showing how to manipulate this one serves as a good template for others.</p>

<p>Curious that they dropped the territories from their chart, given that Nunavut has such a high donation amount.</p>
<p>Now we can plot the normalized data to find how the rank order changes. We’ll add the Canadian average as a blue line for comparison.</p>
<p><img src="https://matt.routleynet.org/uploads/2019/b13177f51c.png" width="672" /></p>
<p>I’m not comfortable with using median donations (adjusted for income or not) to say anything in particular about the residents of a province. But, I’m always happy to look more closely at data and provide some context for public debates.</p>
<p>One major gap with this type of analysis is that we’re only looking at the median donations of people that donated anything at all. In other words, we aren’t considering anyone who donates nothing. We should really compare these median donations to the total population or the size of the economy. This <a href="http://www.statcan.gc.ca/pub/11-008-x/2012001/article/11637-eng.htm">Stats Can</a> study is a much more thorough look at the issue.</p>
<p>For me the interesting result here is the dramatic difference between Quebec and the rest of the provinces. But, I don’t interpret this to mean that Quebecers are less generous than the rest of Canada. Seems more likely that there are material differences in how the Quebec economy and social safety nets are structured.</p>

        <div class="e-content">
         	<p>The TTC releasing their <a href="http://www1.toronto.ca/wps/portal/contentonly?vgnextoid=fa6be8c5a612c510VgnVCM10000071d60f89RCRD">Subway Delay Data</a> was great news. I’m always happy to see more data released to the public. In this case, it also helps us investigate one of the great, enduring mysteries: Is Friday the 13th actually an unlucky day?</p>
<p>As always, we start by downloading and manipulating the data. I’ve added in two steps that aren’t strictly necessary. One is converting the Date, Time, and Day columns into a single Date column. The other is to drop most of the other columns of data, since we aren’t interested in them here.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>url <- "http://www1.toronto.ca/City%20Of%20Toronto/Information%20&%20Technology/Open%20Data/Data%20Sets/Assets/Files/Subway%20&%20SRT%20Logs%20(Jan01_14%20to%20April30_17).xlsx"
filename <- basename(url)
download.file(url, destfile = filename, mode = "wb")
delays <- readxl::read_excel(filename, sheet = 2) %>% 
  dplyr::mutate(date = lubridate::ymd_hm(paste(`Date`,

<p>Now we have a <code>delays</code> dataframe with 69043 incidents starting from 2014-01-01 00:21:00 and ending at 2017-04-30 22:13:00. Before we get too far, we’ll take a look at the data. A heatmap of delays by day and hour should give us some perspective.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>delays %>% 
  dplyr::mutate(day = lubridate::day(date),
         hour = lubridate::hour(date)) %>% 
  dplyr::group_by(day, hour) %>%

    ggplot2::scale_fill_gradient2() + 
    ggplot2::theme(legend.position = "right") +

<p>Other than a reliable band of calm very early in the morning, no obvious patterns here.</p>
<p>We need to identify any days that are a Friday the 13th. We also might want to compare weekends, regular Fridays, other weekdays, and Friday the 13ths, so we add a <code>type</code> column that provides these values. Here we use the <code>case_when</code> function:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>delays <- delays %>% 
    dplyr::mutate(type = case_when( # Partition into Friday the 13ths, Fridays, weekends, and weekdays
      lubridate::wday(.$date) %in% c(1, 7) ~ "weekend",
      lubridate::wday(.$date) %in% c(6) & 
        lubridate::day(.$date) == 13 ~ "Friday 13th",
      lubridate::wday(.$date) %in% c(6) ~ "Friday",
      TRUE ~ "weekday" # Everything else is a weekday
  )) %>% 
  dplyr::mutate(type = factor(type)) %>% 
  dplyr::group_by(type)
delays</code></pre>
<pre><code>## # A tibble: 69,043 x 3

<p>With the data organized, we can start with just a simple box plot of the minutes of delay by <code>type</code>.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>ggplot2::ggplot(delays, aes(type, delay)) +
  ggplot2::geom_boxplot() + 
  ggplot2::labs(x = "Type", y = "Minutes of delay")</code></pre>
<p><img src="https://matt.routleynet.org/uploads/2019/5f349287d0.png" width="672" /></p>
<p>Not very compelling. Basically most delays are short (as in zero minutes long) with many outliers.</p>
<p>How about if we summed up the total minutes in delays for each of the types of days?</p>
<pre class="r"><code>delays %>% 
  dplyr::summarise(total_delay = sum(delay))</code></pre>
<pre><code>## # A tibble: 4 x 2
##          type total_delay
##        <fctr>       <dbl>
## 1      Friday       18036
## 2 Friday 13th         619
## 3     weekday       78865
## 4     weekend       28194</code></pre>
<p>Clearly the total minutes of delays are much shorter for Friday the 13ths. But, there aren’t very many such days (only 6 in fact). So, this is a dubious analysis.</p>
<p>Let’s take a step back and calculate the average of the total delay across the entire day for each of the types of days. If Friday the 13ths really are unlucky, we would expect to see longer delays, at least relative to a regular Friday.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>daily_delays <- delays %>% # Total delays in a day
  dplyr::mutate(year = lubridate::year(date),
                day = lubridate::yday(date)) %>% 
  dplyr::group_by(year, day, type) %>% 
  dplyr::summarise(total_delay = sum(delay))

mean_daily_delays <- daily_delays %>% # Average delays in each type of day
  dplyr::group_by(type) %>% 
  dplyr::summarise(avg_delay = mean(total_delay))
mean_daily_delays</code></pre>
<pre><code>## # A tibble: 4 x 2
##          type avg_delay
##        <fctr>     <dbl>
## 1      Friday 107.35714
## 2 Friday 13th 103.16667
## 3     weekday 113.63833
## 4     weekend  81.01724</code></pre>
<pre class="r"><code>ggplot2::ggplot(daily_delays, aes(type, total_delay)) +
  ggplot2::geom_boxplot() + 
  ggplot2::labs(x = "Type", y = "Total minutes of delay")</code></pre>
<p><img src="https://matt.routleynet.org/uploads/2019/fffb3b2834.png" width="672" /></p>
<p>On average, Friday the 13ths have shorter total delays (103 minutes) than either regular Fridays (107 minutes) or other weekdays (114 minutes). Overall, weekend days have far shorter total delays (81 minutes).</p>
<p>If Friday the 13ths are unlucky, they certainly aren’t causing longer TTC delays.</p>
<p>For the statisticians among you that still aren’t convinced, we’ll run a basic linear model to compare Friday the 13ths with regular Fridays. This should control for many unmeasured variables.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>model <- lm(total_delay ~ type, data = daily_delays, 
            subset = type %in% c("Friday", "Friday 13th"))
summary(model)</code></pre>
<pre><code>##

## lm(formula = total_delay ~ type, data = daily_delays, subset = type %in% 
##     c("Friday", "Friday 13th"))

<p>Definitely no statistical support for the idea that Friday the 13ths cause longer TTC delays.</p>
<p>How about time series tests, like <a href="https://blog.statsbot.co/time-series-anomaly-detection-algorithms-1cef5519aef2">anomaly detections</a>? Seems like we’d just be getting carried away. Part of the art of statistics is knowing when to quit.</p>
<p>In conclusion, then, after likely far too much analysis, we find no evidence that Friday the 13ths cause an increase in the length of TTC delays. This certainly suggests that Friday the 13ths are not unlucky in any meaningful way, at least for TTC riders.</p>
<p>Glad we could put this superstition to rest!</p>

<p>MP Irwin Cotler, a former justice minister, says that the trial will be the first of a child soldier in modern history and that such a trial is prohibited under international humanitarian law. Any thought that something like this might cause the Harper government to reconsider is, of course, risible. These honourable men rebuff their own high court verdicts. They rebuff the will of Parliament – when not shutting it down – on Afghan detainee documents. For them, international law is of trifling concern.</p>

			<h1><a href="https://matt.routleynet.org/2010/06/03/public-service-vs.html">Public service vs. Academics</a></h1>
		

        <a href="https://matt.routleynet.org/2010/06/03/public-service-vs.html" class="u-url"><time class="dt-published" datetime="2010-06-03 19:58:00 -0500">Jun 3, 2010</time></a>

        <div class="e-content">
         	<p>I recently participated in a panel discussion at the <a href="http://www.careers.utoronto.ca/">University of Toronto</a> on the career transition from academic research to public service. I really enjoyed the discussion and there were many great questions from the audience. Here’s just a brief summary of some of the main points I tried to make about the differences between academics and public service.</p>

<p>The major difference I’ve experienced involves a trade-off between control and influence.</p>

<p>As a grad student and post-doctoral researcher I had almost complete control over my work. I could decide what was interesting, how to pursue questions, who to talk to, and when to work on specific components of my research. I believe that I made some <a href="http://files.me.com/mroutley/o38cwy">important</a> <a href="http://files.me.com/mroutley/xura8h">contributions</a> to my field of study. But, to be honest, this work had very little influence beyond a small group of colleagues who are also interested in the evolution of floral form.</p>

<p>Now I want to be clear about this: in no way should this be interpreted to mean that scientific research is not important. This is how scientific progress is made – many scientists working on particular, specific questions that are aggregated into general knowledge. This work is important and deserves support. Plus, it was incredibly interesting and rewarding.</p>

<p>However, the comparison of the influence of my academic research with my work on infrastructure policy is revealing. Roads, bridges, transit, hospitals, schools, courthouses, and jails all have <a href="http://www.mei.gov.on.ca/en/infrastructure/">significant impacts</a> on the day-to-day experience of millions of people. Every day I am involved in decisions that determine where, when, and how the government will invest scarce resources into these important services.</p>

<p>Of course, this is where the control-influence trade-off kicks in. As an individual public servant, I have very little control over these decisions or how my work will be used. Almost everything I do involves medium-sized teams with members from many departments and ministries. This requires extensive collaboration, often under very tight time constraints with high profile outcomes.</p>

<p>For example, in my first week as a <a href="http://www.mei.gov.on.ca/">public servant</a> I started a year-long process to integrate and enhance decision-making processes across 20 ministries and 2 agencies. The project team included engineers, policy analysts, accountants, lawyers, economists, and external consultants from all of the major government sectors. The (rather long) document produced by this process is now used to inform every infrastructure decision made by the province.</p>

<p>Governments contend with really interesting and complicated problems that no one else can or will consider. Businesses generally take on the easy and profitable issues, while NGOs are able to focus on specific aspects of issues. Consequently, working on government policy provides a seemingly endless supply of challenges and puzzles to solve, or at least mitigate. I find this very rewarding.</p>

<p>None of this is to suggest that either option is better than the other. I’ve been lucky to have had two very interesting careers so far, which have been at the opposite ends of this control-influence trade-off. Nonetheless, my experience suggests that an actual academic career is incredibly challenging to obtain and may require significant compromises. Public service can offer many of the same intellectual challenges with better job prospects and work-life balance. But, you need to be comfortable with the diminished control.</p>

<p>Thanks to my colleague <a href="http://ca.linkedin.com/pub/andrew-miller/14/83a/148">Andrew Miller</a> for creating the panel and inviting me to participate. The experience led me to think more clearly about my career choices and I think the panel was helpful to some University of Toronto grad students.</p>

<p>Science is not a cold body of facts, but an organized system of inquiry, discovery, evaluation and learning. Science not only welcomes the correction of errors, its key attribute is that it is self-correcting over time. As new research arises, old hypotheses gain or lose support. While this process never stops, generally accepted conclusions do accumulate, based on the overwhelming weight of evidence. The fact and threat of anthropogenic climate change are clearly among those conclusions.</p>

<p>It is time, finally, to learn from our mistakes.

Keep in mind that global energy demand will double by 2050. Based on our current progress, it is clear that alternative technologies will not be ready to play a significant role.</p>

As a direct result, New World computers do not need virus scanners, their batteries last longer, and they rarely crash, but their users have lost a degree of freedom. New World computers have unprecedented ease of use, and benefit from decades of research into human-computer interaction. They are immediately understandable, fast, stable, and laser-focused on the 80% of the famous 80/20 rule.</p>

The fault presumably lay with building managers who made numerous small mistakes—overheating, overcooling, misusing timers, miscalibrating equipment. The buildings’ owners, with LEED banners already hanging in their lobbies, had little incentive to demand better day-to-day performance.</p>

<p>The danger in all this is not just a corruption of science but also an emasculation of politics. The key debates about climate change are political, not scientific. How much resource should we put into mitigating emissions and how much into adapting to a warmer world? How do you deal with the fact that slower economic growth may produce less CO2 but may also make it harder for people in developing countries to climb out of poverty? How do we weigh the moral good of cheaper travel with the moral good of reduced emissions? And so on. These are debates about political principles and ethical values that no amount of scientific data can resolve. The trouble is, the more we insist that ‘the science tells us what to do’, the less we are able to engage in the kinds of debates necessary to resolve such issues.</p>

<p>Back in the good old days when the bargain was firmly in place, it would have been highly inappropriate for a bureaucrat to do as Richard Colvin did in his testimony before the special committee on Afghanistan, and effectively blow the whistle on the government from his safe perch in the embassy in Washington. If he gave advice and was ignored, he should have resigned or kept quiet. And if asked by a parliamentary committee to testify, his answer would have been something like, “if you want to know what advice I gave the minister, ask the minister.”</p>

<p>Now, people waiting in queues will be questioned about why they are there - their likely response being that the health authorities have for months urged them to be there and indeed initially opened clinics to all. If they don’t fall into one of the risk groups, they will be weeded out. The Public Health Agency of Canada, and other health authorities, along with their political masters, should not be surprised by the resulting public fury.</p>

<p>Looking back over human history, rationality has been the anomaly. Being rational takes work, education, and a sober determination to avoid making hasty inferences, even when they appear to make perfect sense. Much like infectious diseases themselves — beaten back by decades of effort to vaccinate the populace — the irrational lingers just below the surface, waiting for us to let down our guard.</p>

Because they’re focused only on “priorities”, and are paying attention only to the most intheir- face stuff, everyone else has to raise the noise level to “emergency” mode to get any audience at all.

<blockquote>
  <p>My research compared the achievements of Canadian public service and political leaders with their U.K. counterparts, and the results are very favourable to Canada. It was rewarding to hear so many U.K. public service leaders ask about Canadian reforms. It seems that public service managers around the world are looking carefully at leading practices emerging in Ottawa and the provinces, especially Ontario.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>One of the strange challenges I have as a public servant is the constant description of my colleagues as overpaid and underworked. The classic quote came from John Tory as leader of Ontario&rsquo;s opposition party:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“These kinds of jobs are people who are breathing each other’s exhaust and sitting around, analyzing each other’s papers. There hasn’t been enough attention paid to looking at whether those people are really making a productive contribution to the effective delivery of public services in Ontario.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Of course, you can point to several studies showing how efficient Ontario&rsquo;s public servants are and how much the <a href="http://growinggap.ca/campaigns/public_spending">public benefits</a> from government services, but people aren&rsquo;t interested in reviewing this kind of evidence. So, I&rsquo;m happy to see Tony Dean advocating for public servants. I think that strong advocacy from public servant leaders will help much more than statistics.</p>

<p>A good read on the mathematics of scaling in urban patterns. I had looked into using the Bettencourt paper (cited in this article) for making allocation decisions. The trick is moving from the general patterns observed in urban scaling to specific recommendations for where to invest in new infrastructure. This is particularly challenging in the absence of good, detailed data on the current infrastructure stock. We’ve made good progress on gathering some of this data, and it might be worth revisiting this scaling relationship.</p>

         	<p>I’m certain that paying attention to where my food comes from is important. Food production influences my health, has environmental consequences, and affects both urban and rural design. Ideally, I would develop relationships with local farmers, carefully choose organic produce, and always consider broad environmental impacts. Except, I like to spend time with my young family, try to get some exercise, and have more than enough commitments through work to actually spend this much effort on food choices. So, I’ve outsourced this process to the excellent <a href="http://www.mamaearth.ca/">Mama Earth Organics</a>.</p>

<p>Every week a basket of fresh organic and/or local fruit and vegetables arrives on our doorstep. Part of the fun of this service is that different items arrive each week, which diversifies our weekly food routine. But, we always know what’s coming several days in advance, so we can plan our meals well ahead of time. After over a year of service, we’ve only had a single complaint about quality and this was handled very quickly by Mama Earth with a full refund plus credit.</p>

<p>We’ve found the small basket is sufficient for two adults and a picky four-year old. We’ve also added in some fresh bread from St. John’s Bakery, which has been consistently delicious and lasts through most of the week.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>&hellip; in Saskatoon today, Bay Street investors and a group of chiefs from Saskatchewan and Alberta will formally announce the unlikeliest of marriages, one that will make them the most influential farmers in all of Canada, with a super-sized one-million-acre operation that could rival the largest corporate farms in the world.</p>
  
  <p>Under the plan, 17 native bands will lease their land at market value to a new entity called One Earth Farms Corporation, which will focus on sustainable, environmentally responsible land use, hire and train aboriginal workers, and provide first nations an equity stake in the company.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is an interesting initiative and worth tracking &ndash; not because of the massive size of the project. Rather, the partnership between bands and investors is novel.</p>

<p>I find this amazing. How can the minister of science&rsquo;s views on the fundamental unifying theory of biology not be important?</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t expect him to understand the details of evolutionary theory or to have all of his personal beliefs vetted and religious views muted. However, I do expect him &ndash; as minister &ndash; to champion and support Canadian science, especially basic research. When our minister refuses to acknowledge the fundamental discoveries of science, our reputation is diminished.</p>

<p>There is also a legitimate &ndash; though rather exaggerated &ndash; concern that the minister&rsquo;s views on the truth can influence policy and funding decisions. The funding councils are more than sufficiently independent to prevent any undue ministerial influence here. The real problem is an apparent distrust or lack of interest in basic research from the federal government.</p>

<p>Rex Murphy is great at this.</p>

<p>His main point is certainly right: we can&rsquo;t have the many benefits of energy without consequence and the National Geographic neglected to show these benefits. However, I do think that Canadians need to be aware of the trade-offs we are making and mitigate &ndash; to the extent possible &ndash; threats to our environment. For most of us, energy just appears when we flip a switch or drive to the gas station.</p>

<p>I think the tar sands are an important Canadian resource and with careful stewardship their benefits could far exceed their costs. However, my sense is that current policies are not focussed on stewardship and we risk squandering the opportunities provided by the tar sands.</p>

Lots of Canadians are prepared to risk prosecution and defy the ban on funding Abdelrazik. Through an explicit civil disobedience project called Operation Fly Home, spearheaded by Mary Foster in Montreal, a first group of 115 Canadians have so far donated small sums to buy his air ticket home. All of us are making our names and addresses public, so the Mounties won&rsquo;t have trouble finding us. Our crime? Paying $20 dollars or so to bring home a stranded fellow Canadian whose only crime is his name and religion.</p>

Sentences</a>
by Don Watson is a wonderful book – simultaneously funny, scary, and
inspiring – that describes how “clichés, weasel words, and
management-speak” are infecting public language.</p>

<p>The humour comes from Watson’s acerbic commentary and fantastic scorn
for phrases like:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Given the within year and budget time flexibility accorded to the
  science agencies in the determination of resource allocation from
  within their global budget, a multi-parameter approach to
  maintaining the agencies budgets in real terms is not appropriate.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The book is scary because it makes a strong argument for the dangers
of this type of language.  Citizens become confused and disinterested,
customers become jaded, and people loose their love for language.
Also, as a public servant I see this kind of language every day and
often find myself struggling to avoid banality and cliches (not to
mention bullet points).  We need more forceful advocates like Don
Watson to call out politicians and corporations for abusing our
language.  This book certainly makes me want to try harder.  And
what’s more inspiring than struggling for a good cause against long
odds?</p>

<p>The book also has a great glossary of typical weasel words with possible synonyms. So, I’m keeping the book in my office for quick reference.</p>

        <div class="e-content">
         	<p>After seventeen years as a vegetarian, I recently switched back to an
omnivore. My motivation for not eating meat was environmental, since,
on average, a vegetarian diet requires much less land, water, and
energy.  This is still the right motivation, but over the last year or
so I’ve been rethinking my decision to not eat meat.</p>

<p>My concern was that I’d stopped paying attention to my food choices
and a poorly considered vegetarian diet can easily yield a bad
environmental outcome.  In particular, modern agriculture now takes
<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/10/12/magazine/12policy-t.html?_r=2&pagewanted=all">10 calories of fossil fuel energy to produce a single calorie of
food</a>.  This is clearly unsustainable.  We cannot rely on
non-renewable, polluting resources for our food, nor can we continue
to transport food great distances – even if it is only vegetables.
My unexamined commitment to a vegetarian diet was no longer consistent
with environmental sustainability.</p>

<p>I think the solution is to eat local, organic food.  This also
requires eating seasonal food, but Canadian winters are horrible for
local vegetables.  This left me wanting to support local agriculture,
but unable to restrict my diet.  Returning to my original motivation
to choose environmentally appropriate food convinced me it was time to
return to being an omnivore. My new policy is to follow Michael
Pollan’s advice: “Eat food. Mostly plants. Not too much.”  In
addition, I’ll favour locally grown, organic food and include small
amounts of meat – which I hope will predominantly come from carefully
considered and sustainable sources.  I’ve also deciced that when faced
with a dillema of choosing either local or organic, I’ll choose local.
We need to support local agriculture and I’ll trade this for organic
if necessary.  Of course, in the majority of cases local and organic
options are available, and I’ll choose them.</p>

<p>This is a big change and I look forward to exploring food again.</p>

<p>It worked. But the subsidies to farmers at times approached $1,000 (U.S.) a tonne. Last year, the Saudis finally concluded that desert wheat made no more sense than Nunavut pineapples. The farms will disappear within a few years, after which the country will be entirely dependent on imports. But from where?</p>

<p>Answer: from any nation willing to sell or lease vast tracts of its farmland and-here’s the kicker-allow the Saudis to export most or all of the food grown there back home, bypassing the international market. Such “offshore farms” are a quiet, though burgeoning, form of neo-colonialism. And they have the potential to unleash a new food crisis.</p>

To draw an analogy, it is like trying to fix a car without properly understanding how it works: not impossible, but as likely as not to result in a breakdown or a crash. Perhaps, after a century and a half, it is time not just to recognise but also to understand that human beings are evolved creatures. To know thyself is, after all, the beginning of wisdom.</p>

         	<p>The Food Issue - An Open Letter to the Next Farmer in Chief</p>

<p>Michael Pollan describes the upcoming food crisis in an open letter to the next President of the United States.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>This, in brief, is the bad news: the food and agriculture policies you’ve inherited — designed to maximize production at all costs and relying on cheap energy to do so — are in shambles, and the need to address the problems they have caused is acute. The good news is that the twinned crises in food and energy are creating a political environment in which real reform of the food system may actually be possible for the first time in a generation.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The core of his solution is:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>&hellip; we need to wean the American food system off its heavy 20th-century diet of fossil fuel and put it back on a diet of contemporary sunshine</p>

        <div class="e-content">
         	<p>Like most Canadians, I’ll be at the polls today for the 2008 Federal Election.</p>

<p>In the past several elections, I’ve cast my vote for the party with the best climate change plan.  The <a href="http://econ-environment.ca/" title="An Open Letter to the Leaders of Canada’s Federal Political Parties">consensus among economists</a> is that any credible plan must set a price on carbon emissions. My personal preference is for a predictable and transparent price to influence consumer spending, so I favour a carbon tax over a cap-and-trade. Enlightening discussions of these issues are available at <a href="http://worthwhile.typepad.com/worthwhile_canadian_initi/environment/" title="Worthwhile Canadian Initiative: Environment">Worthwhile Canadian Initiative</a>, <a href="http://www.theglobeandmail.com/opinions/columnists/Jeffrey+Simpson.html" title="globeandmail.com: Opinions - Jeffrey Simpson">Jeffrey Simpson’s column</a> at the Globe and Mail, or his book <a href="http://www.amazon.ca/gp/product/0771080972?ie=UTF8&tag=matthewroutle-20&linkCode=as2&camp=15121&creative=330641&creativeASIN=0771080972">Hot Air</a><img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.ca/e/ir?t=matthewroutle-20&l=as2&o=15&a=0771080972" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;"/>.</p>

<p>Until now this voting principle has meant a vote for the <a href="http://www.greenparty.ca/">Green Party</a> who support a tax shift from income to pollution. My expectation for this vote was not that the Green Party would gain any direct political power, rather their environmental plan would gain political profile and convince the Liberals and Conservatives to improve their plans. A carbon tax is now a central component of this year’s <a href="http://www.liberal.ca/platform_e.aspx" title="Liberal.ca :: Richer, Fairer, Greener : An Action Plan for the 21st Century">Liberal Platform</a> with the <a href="http://www.thegreenshift.ca/default_e.aspx" title="thegreenshift.ca">Green Shift</a>. Both the <a href="http://www.conservative.ca/EN/4739/78192">Conservative Pary</a> and <a href="http://www.ndp.ca/platform/environment/" title="A Plan for the Environment That Will Really Work | NDP">NDP</a> support a limited cap-and-trade system on portions of the economy, with the Conservatives supporting dubious “intensity-based” targets.</p>

<p>Although I quite like the central components of the Green Shift, I’m not too keen on the distracting social engineering aspects of the plan. Furthermore, the Liberals have certainly failed to implement any of their previous climate change plans while in power. Nonetheless, I do think (hope?) they will follow through this time and I prefer supporting a well-conceived plan that may not be implemented than a poor plan. Despite my support for this plan, I think the Liberals have done a rather poor job of explaining the Green Shift and have conducted a disappointing campaign.</p>

<p>In the end, my principle will hold. I’m voting for the Green Shift and, reluctantly, the Liberal Party of Canada.</p>

  <p>For us the world is vastly simpler in some sense than the academy, vastly more complicated in another.

In some situations, you can be extremely wrong and be fine, in others you can be slightly wrong and explode. If you are leveraged, errors blow you up; if you are not, you can enjoy life.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The core of any government reflects the personality of the prime minister, because everyone in the system responds to his or her ways of thinking, personality traits, political ambitions and policy preferences. Know the prime minister; know the government.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Harper has been an enigma and learning more about his personal policies and approach to governance is very useful while thinking about the upcoming election.</p>

<p>A general summary of the article comes from near the end:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>And the long-distance runner – bright, intense, strategic, cautious and confident in every stride – has certainly got things done, from merging two parties, to winning a minority government, to fulfilling most of his campaign promises.</p>
  
  <p>He also has pursued two broad changes in the nature of the federal government: giving the provinces more running room by keeping Ottawa out of some of their affairs and giving individuals a bit more money in the form of tax reductions, credits and child-care cheques.</p>
  
  <p>And yet, despite these policies that he assumed would be popular, despite all the problems on the Liberal side, despite raising far more money, despite governing in mostly excellent economic times, despite stroking Quebec, despite gearing up for elections, his Conservatives have yet to break through decisively.</p>

<p>Dan Gardner interviews Harvard University economist Gregory Mankiw on climate change economics. The article is an interesting description of the differences between cap-and-trade and carbon tax policies.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>So why is the cap-and-trade option preferred by almost all politicians? As usual, it&rsquo;s politics. Under cap-and-trade, politicians can claim they are hitting &ldquo;big polluters&rdquo; while leaving the ordinary person unscathed. That&rsquo;s nonsense, of course. Costs borne by big polluters will be passed on, so the ordinary person pays either way. But with cap-and-trade, unlike a carbon tax, the cost to the ordinary person is hidden.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.kungfugrippe.com/post/48588149/better">www.kungfugrippe.com/post/4858&hellip;</a></p>

<p>This is an excellent post by Merlin Mann and something I&rsquo;ve been thinking about a fair bit recently.</p>

<p>Now that I&rsquo;m halfway through my parental leave with Kelly and the kids, I&rsquo;m wondering about all of the distractions I have opted into &ndash; especially on the internet. When I have a few free minutes, is refreshing my Twitter feed really a priority? It shouldn&rsquo;t be. So, I&rsquo;ve been cutting back, cancelling my Facebook, Digg, Reddit, Last.fm, etc. accounts and trying to be much more careful with my time and attention.</p>

<p>This report is well worth a read just for the direct &ndash; almost sarcastic &ndash; writing. Some of the report&rsquo;s commentary on the bureaucratic replies to the senate committee&rsquo;s queries is fantastic.</p>

His &ldquo;Close to Paradise&rdquo; album is inventive with intriguing lyrics, unique sounds, and an often driving piano track. Particular stand out tracks are <a href="http://phobos.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewAlbum?i=187018157&amp;id=187017583&amp;s=143455">Luscious Life</a>, <a href="http://phobos.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewAlbum?i=187018250&amp;id=187017583&amp;s=143455">Drifters</a>, and <a href="http://phobos.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewAlbum?i=187018471&amp;id=187017583&amp;s=143455">The Great Escape</a>.

<blockquote>As a result of actions taken in Budget 2007, Canada&rsquo;s marginal       effective tax rate (METR) on new business investment improved from       third-highest in the G7 to third-lowest by 2011.</blockquote>

<p>Fair enough, tax rates are projected to decline. But notice how they phrase the context of this reduction. Moving from third highest to third lowest is, in a list of seven countries, a change from third to fifth. Not a dramatic change &ndash; we were near the middle and we still are.</p>

         	<p>TVO’s The Agenda had an interesting <a href="http://www.tvo.org/cfmx/tvoorg/theagenda/index.cfm?page_id=7&bpn=379035&ts=2007-03-27%2020:00:00.0">show</a> on the debate between evolutionary biology and creationism. <a href="http://pondside.uchicago.edu/ecol-evol/faculty/coyne_j.html">Jerry Coyne</a> provided a great overview of evolution and a good defence during the debate.</p>

<p>The debate offered a great illustration of the intellectual vacuity that characterises creationism (aka intelligent design). Paul Nelson offers up an <a href="http://www.pnas.org/cgi/content/abstract/104/7/2043">article</a> by Doolittle and Bapteste as proof that Darwinism is unravelling. I suspect he hopes no one will read past the abstract to discover the reasonable debate scientists are having about the universality of a single tree of life. He certainly doesn’t want you to notice that the entire article is couched within evolutionary theory and not once does it claim that Darwinism has been falsified.</p>

<p>Here’s the hypothesis that Doolittle and Bapteste are evaluating:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“that there should be a universal TOL [tree of life], dichotomously branching all of the way down to a single root.” p2045</p>
</blockquote>

<p>They then establish that gene transfer often occurs between lineages, particularly among prokaryotes, and consequently this universal tree of life does not exist. Certainly this complicates the construction of molecular trees and shows the importance for pluralism of mechanism in biology. But they write much more about the overall significance of this work.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“To be sure, much of evolution has been tree-like and is captured in hierarchical classifications.” p2048</p>
  
  <p>“…it would be perverse to claim that Darwin’s TOL hypothesis has been falsified for animals (the taxon to which he primarily addressed himself) or that it is not an appropriate model for many taxa at many levels of analysis” p2048</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And the crucial quote in this context:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Holding onto this ladder of pattern […] should not be an essential element in our struggle against those who doubt the validity of evolutionary theory, who can take comfort from this challenge to the TOL only by a willful misunderstanding of its import.” p2048</p>
</blockquote>

         	<p>Note – This post has been updated from 2007-03-20 to describe new installation instructions.</p>

<h3>Overview</h3>

<p>I’ve integrated <a href="http://www.stikkit.com/">Stikkit</a> into most of my workflow and am quite happy with the results. However, one missing piece is quick access to Stikkit from the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command_line_interface">command line</a>. In particular, a quick list of my undone todos is quite useful without having to load up a web browser.
To this end, I’ve written a <a href="http://www.ruby-lang.org/">Ruby</a> script for interacting with Stikkit. As I mentioned, my real interest is in listing undone todos. But I decided to make the script more general, so you can ask for specific types of stikkits and restrict the stikkits with specific parameters. Also, since the <a href="http://www.stikkit.com/api">stikkit api</a> is so easy to use, I added in a method for creating new stikkits.</p>

<h3>Usage</h3>

<p>The general use of the script is to list stikkits of a particular type, filtered by a parameter. For example,</p>

<pre><code>ruby stikkit.rb --list calendar dates=today</code></pre>

<p>will show all of today’s calendar events. While,</p>

<pre><code>ruby stikkit.rb -l todos done=0</code></pre>

<p>lists all undone todos. The use of -l instead of <code>--list</code> is simply a standard convenience. Furthermore, since this last example comprises almost all of my use for this script, I added a convenience method to get all undone todos</p>

<pre><code>ruby stikkit.rb -t</code></pre>

<p>A good way to understand stikkit types and parameters is to keep an eye on the url while you interact with Stikkit in your browser.
To create a new stikkit, use the <code>--create</code> flag,</p>

<pre><code>ruby stikkit.rb -c 'Remember me.'</code></pre>

<p>The text you pass to stikkit.rb will be processed as usual by Stikkit.</p>

<h3>Installation</h3>

<p>Grab the script from the <a href="http://code.google.com/p/stikkit-rb/">Google Code project</a> and put it somewhere convenient. Making the file executable and adding it to your path will cut down on the typing. The script reads from a .stikkit file in your path that contains your username and password. Modify this template and save it as ~/.sikkit</p>

<pre><code>
     ---
     username: me@domain.org 
     password: superSecret 
</code></pre>

<p>The script also requires the <a href="http://split-s.blogspot.com/2006/04/atom-10-parser-for-ruby.html">atom gem</a>, which you can grab with</p>

<pre><code>gem install atom</code></pre>

<p>I’ve tried to include some flexibility in the processing of stikkits. So, if you don’t like using <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atom">atom</a>, you can switch to a different <a href="http://stikkit.com/api#responses">format</a> provided by Stikkit. The text type requires no gems, but makes picking out pieces of the stikkits challenging.</p>

<h3>Feedback</h3>

<p>This script serves me well, but I’m interested in making it more useful. Feel free to pass along any comments or feature requests.</p>

Since my main source of national news and analysis is the <a href="http://www.theglobeandmail.com/">Globe and Mail</a>, I’m quite happy that they provide <a href="http://www.theglobeandmail.com/rss/">many feeds</a> for accessing their content. The problem is that many news stories are duplicated across these feeds. Furthermore, tracking all of the feeds of interest is challenging.</p>

<p>The new <a href="http://pipes.yahoo.com/">Yahoo Pipes</a> offer a solution to these problems. Without providing too much detail, pipes are a way to filter, connect, and generally mash-up the web with a straightforward interface. I’ve used this service to collect all of the Globe and Mail feeds of interest, filter out the duplicates, and produce a feed I can subscribe to. Nothing fancy, but quite useful. <a href="http://pipes.yahoo.com/pipes/pipe.info?_id=YjZyKsHM2xGr3_z5l7okhQ">The pipe</a> is publicly available and if you don’t agree with my choice of news feeds, you are free to clone mine and create your own. There are plenty of other pipes available, so take a look to see if anything looks useful to you. Even better, create your own.</p>

<p>If you really want those details, Tim O'Reilly <a href="http://radar.oreilly.com/archives/2007/02/pipes_and_filte.html">has plenty</a>.</p>

         	<p>My experiences helping people manage their data has repeatedly shown that databases are poorly understood. This is well illustrated by the rampant abuses of spreadsheets for recording, manipulating, and analysing data.</p>

<p>Most people realise that they should be using a database, the real issue is the difficulty of creating a proper database. This is a legitimate challenge. Typically, you need to carefully consider all of the categories of data and their relationships when creating the database, which makes the upfront costs quite significant. Why not just start throwing data into a spreadsheet and worry about it later?</p>

<p>I think that <a href="http://dabbledb.com/">DabbleDB</a> can solve this problem. A great strength of Dabble –- and the source of its name — is that you can start with a simple spreadsheet of data and progressively convert it to a database as you begin to better understand the data and your requirements.</p>

<p>Dabble also has a host of great features for working with data. I’ll illustrate this with a database I created recently when we were looking for a new home. This is a daunting challenge. We looked at dozens of houses each with unique pros and cons in different neighbourhoods and with different price ranges. I certainly couldn’t keep track of them all.</p>

<p>I started with a simple list of addresses for consideration. This was easily imported into Dabble and immediately became useful. Dabble can export to <a href="http://earth.google.com/">Google Earth</a>, so I could quickly have an overview of the properties and their proximity to amenities like transit stops and parks. Next, I added in a field for asking price and MLS url which were also exported to Google Earth. Including price gave a good sense of how costs varied with location, while the url meant I could quickly view the entire listing for a property.</p>

<p>Next, we started scheduling appointments to view properties. Adding this to Dabble immediately created a calendar view. Better yet, Dabble can export this view as an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ICalendar">iCal</a> file to add into a calendaring program.</p>

<p>Once we started viewing homes, we began to understand what we really were looking for in terms of features. So, add these to Dabble and then start grouping, searching, and sorting by these attributes.</p>

<p>All of this would have been incredibly challenging without Dabble. No doubt, I would have simply used a spreadsheet and missed out on the rich functionality of a database.</p>

<p>Dabble really is worth a look. The best way to start is to watch the <a href="http://dabbledb.com/explore/7minutedemo/">seven minute demo</a> and then review some of the great <a href="http://dabbledb.com/explore/screencasts/">screencasts</a>.</p>

         	<p>I like to believe that my brain is useful for analysis, synthesis, and creativity. Clearly it is not proficient at storing details like specific dates and looming reminders. Nonetheless, a great deal of my mental energy is devoted to trying to remember such details and fearing the consequences of the inevitable “it slipped my mind”. As counselled by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GTD">GTD</a>, I need a good and trustworthy system for removing these important, but distracting, details and having them reappear when needed. I’ve finally settled in on the new product from <a href="http://www.valuesofn.com/">values of n</a> called <a href="http://stikkit.com/">Stikkit</a>.</p>

<p>Stikkit appeals to me for two main reasons: easy data entry and smart text processing. Stikkit uses the metaphor of the yellow sticky note for capturing text. When you create a new note, you are presented with a simple text field — nothing more. However, Stikkit parses your note for some key words and extracts information to make the note more useful. For example, if you type:</p>

<pre><code>Phone call with John Smith on Feb 1 at 1pm
</code></pre>

<p>Stikkit realises that you are describing an event scheduled for February 1st at one in the afternoon with a person (“peep” in Stikkit slang) named John Smith. A separate note will be created to track information about John Smith and will be linked to the phone call note. If you add the text “remind me” to the note, Stikkit will send you an email and SMS message prior to the event. You can also include tags to group notes together with the keywords “tag as”.</p>

<p>A recent update to peeps makes them even more useful. Stikkit now collects information about people as you create notes. So, for example, if I later post:</p>

<pre><code>- Send documents to John Smith john@smith.net
</code></pre>

<p>Stikkit will recognise John Smith and update my peep for him with the email address provided. In this way, Stikkit becomes more useful as you continue to add information to notes. Also, the prefixed “-” causes Stikkit to recognise this note as a todo. I can then list all of my todos and check them off as they are completed.</p>

<p>This text processing greatly simplifies data entry, since I don’t need to click around to create todos are choose dates from a calendar picker. Just type in the text, hit save, and I’m done. Fortunately, Stikkit has been designed to be smart rather than clever. The distinction here is that Stikkit relies on some key words (such as at, for, to) to mark up notes consistently and reliably. Clever software is exemplified by Microsoft Word’s autocorrect or clipboard assistant. My first goal when encountering these “features” is to turn them off. I find they rarely do the right thing and end up being a hindrance. <a href="http://stikkit.com/">Stikkit</a> is well worth a look. For a great overview check out the <a href="http://community.valuesofn.com/stikkit/index.php?board=15.0">screencasts</a> in the forum.</p>

<p>I grabbed this image while preparing a new Windows machine. This seems to be an interesting comparison of the difference in design approaches between Apple and PC remotes. Both provide essentially the same functions. Clearly, however, one is more complex than the other. Which would you rather use?</p>

        <div class="e-content">
         	<p>I recently helped someone process a text file with the help of Unix command line tools. The job would have been quite challenging otherwise, and I think this represents a useful demonstration of why I choose to use Unix.</p>

<p>The basic structure of the datafile was:</p>

<pre><code>; A general header file ;
1
sample: 0.183 0.874 0.226 0.214 0.921 0.272 0.117
2
sample: 0.411 0.186 0.956 0.492 0.150 0.278 0.110
3
...
</code></pre>

<p>In this case the only important information is the second number of each line that begins with “sample:”. Of course, one option is to manually process the file, but there are thousands of lines, and that’s just silly.</p>

<p>We begin by extracting only the lines that begin with “sample:”. <code>grep</code> will do this job easily:</p>

<pre><code>grep "^sample" input.txt
</code></pre>

<p><code>grep</code> searches through the input.txt file and outputs any matching lines to standard output.</p>

<p>Now, we need the second number. <code>sed</code> can strip out the initial text of each line with a find and replace while <code>tr</code> compresses any strange use of whitespace:</p>

<pre><code>sed 's/sample: //g' | tr -s ' '
</code></pre>

<p>Notice the use of the pipe (<code>|</code>) command here. This sends the output of one command to the input of the next. This allows commands to be strung together and is one of the truly powerful tools in Unix.</p>

<p>Now we have a matrix of numbers in rows and columns, which is easily processed with <code>awk</code>.</p>

<pre><code>awk '{print $2;}'
</code></pre>

<p>Here we ask <code>awk</code> to print out the second number of each row.</p>

<p>So, if we string all this together with pipes, we can process this file as follows:</p>

<pre><code>grep "^sample" input.txt | sed 's/sample: //g' | tr -s ' ' | awk '{print $2;}' > output.txt
</code></pre>

<p>Our numbers of interest are in output.txt.</p>

         	<p>The Stern Review has been in the news recently for predicting that global warming could cost up to $7 trillion if not addressed soon. Of course, this has caused quite a stir as it offsets many of the, likely unfounded, concerns that fixing climate change will cost too much. The <a href="http://www.hm-treasury.gov.uk/independent_reviews/stern_review_economics_climate_change/stern_review_report.cfm">full report</a> is available online and should be a quite interesting, if long, read.</p>

<p>Choosing appropriate software tools can be challenging. Here are the principles I employ when making the decision:</p>

<ul><li>Simple: This seems obvious, but many companies fail here. Typically, their downfall is focussing on a perpetual increase in feature quantity. I don’t evaluate software with feature counts. Rather, I value software that performs a few key operations well. Small, focussed tools result in much greater productivity than overly-complex, all-in-one tools. 37 Signals’ <a href="http://www.writeboard.com/">Writeboard</a> is a great example of a simple, focussed tool for collaborative writing.</li><li><p>Open formats: I will not choose software that uses proprietary or closed data formats. Closed formats cause two main difficulties:</p></li><li><p>I must pay the proprietor of a closed format for the privilege of accessing my data. Furthermore, switching to a new set of software may require translating my data or, even worse, losing access altogether. Open formats allow me to access my data at any time and with any appropriate tool.</p></li><li><p>My tools are limited to the range of innovations that the proprietor deems important. Open formats allow me to take advantage of any great new tools that come available.</p></li><li><p>Flexible: As my requirements ebb and flow, I shouldn’t be locked into the constraints of a particular tool. The best options are internet-based, subscription plans. If I need more storage space or more access for collaborators, I simply choose a new subscription plan. Then, if things slow down, I can move back down to a basic plan and save money. The online backup service<a href="http://www.joyent.com/connector/Secure-Backups/"> Strongpace</a>, for example, has a subscription plan tied to the amount of storage and number of users required.</p></li><li>Network: A good tool must be fully integrated into the network. The ability to collaborate with anyone or access my data from any computer are great boons to productivity. Many of the best tools are completely internet based; all that is required to use them is a web browser. This also means that the tool is monitored and maintained by a collection of experts and that the tool can be upgraded at any time without being locked into a version-number update. Furthermore, with data maintained on a network, many storage and backup problems are addressed. <a href="http://gmail.google.com/">GMail</a>, for example, stores over 2GB of email, free of charge with an innovative user interface.</li></ul><p><em>Exemplars</em></p>

<p>These are some of my favourite adherents to the principles outlined above:</p>

        <div class="e-content">
         	<p>I generally write my documents in <a href="http://www.maths.lth.se/help/R/.R/library/utils/html/Sweave.html">Sweave</a> format. This approach allows me to embed the code for analyses directly in the report derived from the analyses, so that all results and figures are generated dynamically with the text of the report. This provides both great documentation of the analyses and the convenience of a single file to keep track of and work with.</p>

<p>Now there is a new contender for integrating analysis code and documentation with the release of an R module for <a href="http://wiki.contextgarden.net/Main_Page">ConTeXt</a>. I prefer the clean implementation and modern features of ConTeXt to the excellent, but aging, <a href="http://www.latex-project.org/">LaTeX</a> macro package that Sweave relies on. So, using ConTeXt for my documents is a great improvement.</p>

<p>Here’s a simple example of using this new module. I create two randomly distributed, normal variables, test for a correlation between them, and plot their distribution.</p>

<pre><code>\usemodule[r]

\starttext
Describe the motivation of the analyses first.

Now create some variables.

\startRhidden
x <- rnorm(1000, 0, 1)
y <- rnorm(1000, 0, 1)
\stopRhidden

Are they correlated?

\startR
model <- lm(y ~ x, data = test)
summary(model)
\stopR

Now we can include a figure.

\startR
pdf("testFigure.pdf")
plot(x, y)
dev.off()
\stopR

\startbuffer
\placefigure{Here it is}{\externalfigure[testFigure]}
\stopbuffer
\getbuffer

\stoptext
</code></pre>

<p>Processing this code produces a pdf file with all of the results produced from R, including the figure.</p>

<p>I had some minor difficulties getting this to work on my OS X machine, through no fault of the r module itself. There are two problems. The first is that, by default, write18 is not enabled, so ConTeXt can’t access R directly. Fix this by editing <code>/usr/local/teTeX/texmf.cnf</code> so that “shell_escape = t”. The next is that the R module calls @texmfstart@ which isn’t directly accessible from a stock installation of TeX. The steps required are described in the “Configuration of texmfstart” section of the <a href="http://wiki.contextgarden.net/Mac_Installation">ConTeXt wiki</a>. I modified this slightly by placing the script in <code>~/bin</code> so that I didn’t interfere with the installed teTeX tree. Now everything should work.</p>

        <div class="e-content">
         	<p>Here’s a simple trick for creating experimental designs in R: use the function expand.grid.</p>

<p>A simple example is:</p>

<pre><code>  treatments <- LETTERS[1:4]
  levels <- 1:3
  experiment <- data.frame(expand.grid(treatment=treatments, level=levels))
</code></pre>

<p>which produces:</p>

<pre><code>   treatment level
1          A     1
2          B     1
3          C     1
4          D     1
5          A     2
6          B     2
7          C     2
8          D     2
9          A     3
10         B     3
11         C     3
12         D     3
</code></pre>

<p>Now, if you want to randomize your experimental treatments, try:</p>

<pre><code>  experiment[sample(dim(experiment)[1]), ]
</code></pre>

<p><code>sample</code> randomly chooses numbers from a vector the same length as the <code>experiment</code> data frame without replacement. The square brackets then use this random sample to subsample from the <code>experiment</code> data frame.</p>

         	<p>CBC’s <a href="http://www.cbc.ca/ideas/">Ideas</a> has been running a series of shows on heart disease called “Heart of the Matter”. <a href="http://odeo.com/audio/1168359/view">Episode 2</a> is particularly interesting from a statistical perspective, as the episode discusses several difficulties with the analysis of drug efficacy. Some highlights include:</p>

<p><em>Effect sizes</em> Some of the best cited studies for the use of drugs to treat heart disease show a statistically significant effect of only a few percentage points improvement. Contrast this with a dramatic, vastly superior improvement from diet alone.</p>

<p><em>Response variables</em> The focus of many drug studies has been on the reduction of cholesterol, rather than reductions in heart disease. Diet studies, for example, have shown dramatic improvements in reducing heart attacks while having no effect on cholesterol levels. Conversely, drug studies that show a reduction in cholesterol show no change in mortality rates.</p>

<p><em>Blocking of data</em> Separate analyses of drug efficacy on female or elderly patients tend to show that drug therapy increases overall mortality. Lumping these data in with the traditional middle-aged male patients removes this effect and, instead, shows a significant decrease in heart disease with drug use.</p>

<p>The point here isn’t to make a comment on the influence of drug companies on medical research. Rather, such statistical concerns are common to all research disciplines. The primary concern of such analyses should be: what is the magnitude of the effect of a specific treatment on my variable of interest? The studies discussed in the Ideas program suggest that much effort has been devoted to detecting significant effects of drugs on surrogate response variables regardless of the size of the effect.</p>

        <div class="e-content">
         	<p>When response variables are composed of counts, the standard statistical methods that rely on the normal distribution are no longer applicable. Count data are comprised of positive integers and, often, many zeros. For such data, we need statistics based on Poisson or binomial distributions. I’ve spent the past few weeks analysing counts from hundreds of transects and, as is typical, a particular challenge was determining the appropriate packages to use for <a href="http://wwww.r-project.org/">R</a>. Here’s what I’ve found so far.</p>
<p>The first step is to get an idea of the dispersion of data points:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>Means <- tapply(y, list(x1, x2), mean)
Vars <- tapply(y, list(x1, x2), var)
plot(Means, Vars, xlab="Means", ylab="Variances")
abline(a=0, b=1)</code></pre>
<p>For the Poisson distribution, the mean is equal to the variance. So, we expect the points to lie along the solid line added to the plot. If the points are overdispersed, a negative binomial link function may be more appropriate. The <code>pscl</code> library provides a function to test this:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>library(pscl)
model.nb <- glm.nb(y ~ x, data=data)
odTest(model.nb)
summary(model.nb)</code></pre>
<p>If the <code>odTest</code> function rejects the null model, then the data are overdispersed relative to a Poisson distribution. One particularly useful function is <code>glmmPQL</code> from the <code>MASS</code> library. This function allows for random intercepts and combined with the negative.binomial function of the same library, you can fit a negative binomial GLMM:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>model.glmm.nb <- glmmPQL(y ~ x1 + x2,
                         random= ~ 1|transect, data=data,
                         family=negative.binomial(model.nb$theta))</code></pre>
<p>In this case, I use the Θ estimated from the <code>glm.nb</code> function in the <code>negative.binomial</code> call. Also useful are the <code>zeroinfl</code> function of the <code>pscl</code> library for fitting zero-inflated Poisson or negative binomial models and the <code>geeglm</code> function of <code>geepack</code> for fitting generalized estimating equations for repeated measures. Finally, <code>fitdistr</code> from <code>MASS</code> allows for estimating the parameters of different distributions from empirical data.</p>

         	<p>This is quite a surprise, McGill University’s Brian Alters had his proposal to study the effects of intelligent design on Canadian education rejected by the Canadian <a href="http://www.sshrc-crsh.gc.ca/web/home_e.asp">Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council</a>. A stated reason for the rejection was that Alters did not provide “adequate justification for the assumption in the proposal that the theory of evolution, and not intelligent design theory, was correct.”</p>

<p>Granted, funding proposals can be rejected for a variety of reasons and the opinions of the reviewers do not necessarily reflect those of the funding body. However, the international media (Nature, The Guardian) are reporting on this and the suggestion is that the Canadian Government — or, at least, our funding agency for social science research — rejects evolution.</p>

<p>If SSHRC intends to pass judgement on scientific theories, they should review the evidence first. Biological evolution is a fact. Furthermore, the theory of evolution through natural selection has accumulated 150 years of empirical evidence and ranks as one of science’s greatest insights.</p>

<p>I hope that SSHRC clarifies their position on evolution soon.</p>

         	<p>I’m convinced that no computer display is large enough. What we need are strategies to better manage our computer workspace and application windows. <a href="http://www.apple.com/macosx/features/expose/">Exposé</a> and <a href="http://www.caminobrowser.org/images/screenshots/main_window.jpg">tabbed browsing</a> are great features, but what I really want is the equivalent of a file folder. You put all of the relevant documents in a folder and then put it aside for when you need it. Once you’re ready, you open up the folder and are ready to go.</p>

<p>A feature that comes close to this is virtual desktops. I became enamoured with these while running <a href="http://www.kde.org/">KDE</a> and have found them again for OS X with <a href="http://desktopmanager.berlios.de/">Desktop Manager</a>. The idea is to create workspaces associated with specific tasks as a virtual desktop. You can then switch between these desktops as you move from one project to the next. So, for each of the projects I am currently working on, I’ve created a desktop with each application’s windows in the appropriate place. For a consulting project, I likely have <a href="http://aquamacs.org/">Aquamacs</a> running an R simulation with a terminal window open for updating my subversion repository. A project in the writing stage requires <a href="http://www.uoregon.edu/~koch/texshop/">TeXShop</a> and <a href="http://bibdesk.sourceforge.net/">BibDesk</a>, while a web-design project needs <a href="http://macromates.com/">TextMate</a> and <a href="http://www.caminobrowser.org/">Camino</a>. Each of these workspaces is independent and I can quickly switch to them when needed. Since the applications are running with their windows in the appropriate place, I can quickly get back to work on the project at hand.</p>

<p>Application windows can be split across desktops and specific windows can be present across all desktops. I’ve also found it useful to have one desktop for communication (email, messaging, etc.) and another that has no windows open at all.</p>

        <div class="e-content">
         	<p>As I accumulate projects (both new and completed), the maintenance and storage of the project files becomes increasingly important. There are two important goals for a file structure: find things quickly and don’t lose anything. My current strategy is as follows:</p>

<p>Every project has a consistent folder structure:</p>

<pre><code>|-- analysis
|-- data
|-- db
|-- doc
|-- fig
`-- utils
</code></pre>

<p><em>analysis</em> holds the <a href="http://www.r-project.org">R</a> source files of the analysis. These, typically, are experiments and snippets of code. The main analyses are in the doc directory.</p>

<p><em>data</em> contains data files. Generally, these are csv files from clients.</p>

<p><em>db</em> is for sql dumps of databases and <a href="http://www.sqlite.org/">sqlite</a> files. I prefer working with databases over flat text files or Excel spreadsheets. These files are kept in the data folder and converted to sql databases for analyses.</p>

<p><em>doc</em> holds the analysis and writeup as a <a href="http://www.ci.tuwien.ac.at/~leisch/Sweave/FAQ.html">Sweave</a> file. This combines R and <a href="http://www.latex-project.org/">LaTeX</a> to create a complete document from one source file.</p>

<p><em>fig</em> is for diagrams and plots. Many of these are generated when processing the Sweave file, but some are constructed from other sources.</p>

<p><em>utils</em> holds scripts and binaries that are required to run the analysis.</p>

<p>This entire directory structure is maintained with <a href="http://subversion.tigris.org/">Subversion</a>, so I have a record of changes and can access the project files from any networked computer.</p>

<p>Finally, once a project is complete, I archive the project and construct a sha <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Checksum">checksum</a> of the zip file.</p>

<p><code>openssl dgst -sha1 -out checksums.txt archive.zip</code></p>

<p>This checksum allows me to verify that the archive remains stable over time. Coupled with a good backup routine, this should keep the project files safe.</p>

<p>This may seem elaborate, but data and their analyses are too important to be left scattered around a laptop’s hard drive.</p>

<p>One other approach I’ve considered is using the R package structure to maintain projects. <a href="http://www.maths.bris.ac.uk/~maman/computerstuff/Rhelp/Rpackages.html">This</a> is a useful guide, but the process seems too involved for my purposes.</p>

As I described in an <a href="http://matt.routleynet.org/articles/2006/03/15/remote-data-analysis">earlier post</a>, running simulations can be a challenge with limited computer resources. Rather than waiting hours for my computers to work through thousands of iterations, I could pay Sun $1, which would likely be sufficient for the scale of my work. This would be well worth the investment! I spend a single dollar and quickly get the results I need for my research or clients.</p>

<p>Apparently, the American government has classified the Sun Grid as a weapon, so we can’t access it here in Canada, yet. I’m sure this will change shortly.</p>

One challenge with this approach is backing up files scattered throughout your home folder. The solution is the “Follow symbolic links” option when mirroring. I created a backup folder and populated it with aliases to the files I’m interested in backing up. Mirroring this folder to Strongspace copies the files to the server. The other option is to use the “Skip files with specified names” feature, but this rapidly filled up for me.</p>

         	<p>My six-year old laptop is incredibly slow, particularly when analysing data. Unfortunately, analysing data is my job, so this represents a problem. We have a new and fast desktop at home, but I can’t monopolise its use and it would negate the benefits of mobility.</p>

<p>Fortunately, with the help of <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/emacs.html">Emacs</a> and <a href="http://ess.r-project.org/">ESS</a> there is a solution. I write my <a href="http://www.r-project.org/">R</a> code on the laptop and evaluate the code on the desktop, which sends the responses and plots back to the laptop. I can do this anywhere I have network access for the laptop and the results are quite quick.</p>

<p>There are a few tricks to the setup, especially if you want the plots sent back to the laptop’s screen, so I’ll document the necessary steps here.</p>

<p>First, you need to enable X11 forwarding on both the desktop and laptop computers (see the <a href="http://developer.apple.com/qa/qa2004/qa1383.html">Apple Technote</a>). Then start up <a href="http://www.apple.com/macosx/features/x11/">X11</a> on the laptop.</p>

<p>Now, on the laptop, start up Emacs, open a file with R code and ssh to the desktop:</p>

<p><code>  opt-x ssh -Y desktopip</code></p>

<p>Now, run R in the ssh buffer and link it to the R-code buffer</p>

<p><code>R opt-x ess-remote</code></p>

<p>That should do it. Now I have the speed of the desktop and the benefits of a laptop.</p>

         	<p>I’ve spent the last few days struggling with a problem with Plantae’s rails code. I was certain that code like this should work:</p>

<pre><code>class ContentController < ApplicationController

    @plant = Plant.new(params[:plant])
    if request.post? and @plant.save
      redirect_to :action => 'show', :id => @plant.id

  end

  def show
    @plant = Plant.find(params[:id])
  end
  ...
end
</code></pre>

<p>These statements should create a new plant and then redirect to the show method which sends the newly created plant to the view.</p>

<p>The problem was that rails insisted on asking sqlite3 for the plant with id=0, which cannot exist.</p>

<p>After a post to the rails mailing list and some thorough diagnostics I discovered <a href="http://wiki.rubyonrails.org/rails/pages/HowtoUseSQLite">this</a> and realized I needed swig.</p>

<p>So, if anyone else has this problem:</p>

<pre><code>sudo port install swig
sudo gem install sqlite3-ruby

<p>is the solution.</p>

         	<p>Hermaphroditism is prevalent in plants but may allow interference between male function (pollen removal and dispersal) and female function (pollen receipt and seed production) within a flower. Temporal or spatial segregation of gender within a   hermaphroditic flower may evolve to reduce this interference and enhance male and female reproductive success. We tested this hypothesis using Chamerion angustifolium (Onagraceae), in which pollen removal (male)   and pollen deposition (female) were measured directly on hermaphroditic and experimentally produced unisexual flowers. During a single flower visit in the field, bees deposited 159±24 (SE) pollen grains on a stigma and removed 1058±198 grains from each flower. Anther removal did not alter deposition   rates. In the laboratory, bees removed 2669±273 pollen grains and deposited 209±72.3 cross-pollen and 120±28.4 facilitated self-pollen grains per visit. The presence of anthers significantly reduced cross-pollen deposition on the stigma. In contrast, pollen removal was not affected by presence of the pistil. These results suggest that within-flower interference affects female function and represents a fitness cost that can be reduced through temporal segregation of gender within the flower.</p>

         	<p>In self-compatible plants, small populations may experience reduced outcrossing owing to decreased pollinator visitation and mate availability. We examined the relation between outcrossing and population size in eastern Ontario populations of Aquilegia canadensis. Experimental pollinations showed that the species is highly self-compatible, and can achieve full seed-set in the absence of pollinators via automatic self-pollination. We estimated levels of outcrossing (t) and parental inbreeding coefficients (F) from allozyme variation in naturally pollinated seed families for 10 populations ranging in size from 32 to 750 reproductive individuals. The proportion of seeds produced through outcrossing was generally low (mean = 0.29 +/- 0.02 SE) and varied widely among populations (range = 0.00-0.83). Accordingly, estimates of F were large (mean = 0.26 +/- 0.05) and significantly greater than zero in seven populations. As expected, four small populations (N < 40) outcrossed less (0.17 +/- 0.03) than six large populations (N > 90; 0.38 +/- 0. 03). However, parental plants were not significantly more inbred in small than large populations (P = 0.18). There was no difference in the germination of seeds from hand self- and cross-pollinations. However, population genetic estimates of inbreeding depression for survival expressed from seed to reproductive maturity were very high (mean delta = 1 - relative fitness of selfed seed = 0.88 +/- 0.14). The combination of self-compatibility and automatic self-pollination makes the mating system of A. canadensis sensitive to variation in ecological factors that affect the likelihood of cross-pollination.</p>

        <div class="e-content">
         	<p>Protandry, a form of temporal separation of gender within hermaphroditic flowers, may reduce the magnitude of pollen lost to selfing (pollen discounting) and also serve to enhance pollen export and outcross siring success. Because pollen discounting is strongest when selfing occurs between flowers on the same plant, the advantage of protandry may be greatest in plants with large floral displays. We tested this hypothesis with enclosed, artificial populations of Chamerion angustifolium (Onagraceae) by experimentally manipulating protandry (producing uniformly adichogamous or mixed protandrous and adichogamous populations) and inflorescence size (two-, six-, or 10-flowered inflorescences) and measuring pollinator visitation, seed set, female outcrossing rate, and outcross siring success. Bees spent more time foraging on and visited more flowers of larger inflorescences than small. Female outcrossing rates did not vary among inflorescence size treatments. However, seed set per fruit decreased with increasing inflorescence size, likely as a result of increased abortion of selfed embryos, perhaps obscuring the magnitude of geitonogamous selfing. Protandrous plants had a marginally higher female outcrossing rate than adichogamous plants, but similar seed set. More importantly, protandrous plants had, on average, a twofold siring advantage relative to adichogamous plants. However, this siring advantage did not increase linearly with inflorescence size, suggesting that protandry acts to enhance siring success, but not exclusively by reducing between-flower interference.</p>

        <div class="e-content">
         	<p>Historically, dichogamy (the temporal separation of gender in flowering plants) has been interpreted as a mechanism for avoiding inbreeding. However, a comparative survey found that many dichogamous species are self-incompatible (SI), suggesting dichogamy evolved for other reasons, particularly reducing interference between male and female function. Here we re-examined the association between dichogamy and SI in a phylogenetic framework, and tested the hypothesis that dichogamy evolved to reduce interference between male and female function.  Using paired comparisons and maximum-likelihood correlation analyses, we find that protandry (male function first) is positively correlated with the presence of SI and protogyny (female function first) with self-compatibility (SC). In addition, estimates of transition-rate parameters suggest strong selection for the evolution of SC in protogynous taxa and a constraint against transitions from protandry to protogyny in SC taxa. We interpret these results as support for protandry evolving to reduce interference and protogyny to reduce inbreeding.</p>

        <div class="e-content">
         	<p>Clonal growth in plants can increase pollen and ovule production per genet. However, paternal and maternal reproductive success may not increase because within-clone pollination (geitonogamy) can reduce pollen export to adjacent clones (pollen discounting) and pollen import to the central ramets (pollen limitation). We investigated the relationship between clone size and mating success using clones of Malus x domestica at four orchards (blocks of 1–5 rows of trees). For each block, we measured maternal function as fruit and seed set in all rows and paternal function as siring rate in the first row of the adjacent block. Expected relations between reproductive success and clone size were generated from simulations and data on pollen dispersal in this species. Siring rate per clone averaged 70\% and did not increase significantly with block size, consistent with simulations of pollen dispersal under pollen discounting. Simulations also indicated that the ratio of compatible to incompatible pollen received by a tree should decline with increased block size and from the periphery to the centre of blocks. However, no significant reductions in female function were detected among block sizes or within blocks. Our results suggest that paternal function may be more sensitive to the effects of clonality than female function.</p>

        <div class="e-content">
         	<p>Protandry (when male function precedes female) can enhance fitness by reducing selfing and increasing pollen export and outcrossed siring success. However, responses to selection on protandry may be constrained by genetic variation and correlations among floral traits. We examined these potential constraints in protandrous Chamerion angustifolium (Onagraceae) by estimating genetic variation in male-phase duration and associated floral traits using a paternal half-sib design and selection experiment. Narrow-sense heritability of male-phase duration was estimated as 0.23 (SE +- 0.04) and was positively correlated with floral display. The selection experiment shortened male-phase duration 0.8 SD from the parental average of 17.0 h and lengthened it by 2.0 SD. Furthermore, fixed floral longevity caused a negative association between male- and female-phase durations. These results suggest that selection on male-phase duration is not limited by genetic variation. However, changes in male-phase duration may influence pollinators through correlated changes in floral display and reduced opportunities for pollen receipt during female phase.</p>

        <div class="e-content">
         	<p>Mating by outcrossing plants depends on the frequency and quality of interaction between pollen vectors and individual flowers. However, the historical focus of pollination biology on individual flowers (floricentrism) cannot produce a complete understanding of the role of pollination in plant mating, because mating is an aggregate process, which depends on the reproductive outcomes of all of a plant’s flowers. Simultaneous display of multiple flowers in an inflorescence increases a plant’s attractiveness to pollinators, which should generally enhance mating opportunities. However, whenever pollinators visit multiple flowers on an inflorescence, self-pollination among flowers can reduce the pollen available for export to other plants (pollen discounting) and increase the incidence of inbreeding depression for embryos and offspring. Therefore, the size of floral displays that maximizes mating frequency and quality generally balances the benefits of attractiveness against the costs of self-pollination. This balance can shift considerably if different flowers serve female and male functions at one time (sexual segregation) and flowers are arranged in inflorescences so that pollinators visit female flowers before male flowers. However, the effectiveness of sexual segregation depends on the extent to which a particular inflorescence architecture induces consistent movement patterns by pollinators. In general, the consistency of pollinator movement patterns varies with inflorescence architecture and differs between pollinator types. Such variation creates many options for the evolution of the diverse inflorescence characteristics within angiosperms, which can be appreciated only by moving beyond a floricentric perspective of the role of pollination in plant mating.</p>

         	<p>Pollen and ovules experience diverse fates during pollination, pollen-tube growth, fertilization, and seed development, which govern the male and female potential of flowering plants.  This chapter identifies these fates and many of their interactions, and considers their theoretical implications for the evolution of pollen export and the production of selfed and outcrossed seeds.  This analysis clarifies the importance of pollen quantity and quality for seed production, including the opportunity for poor pollen quality to cause misidentification of pollen limitation.  Our analysis emphasizes the asymmetry of pollen and ovule fates and considers its consequences for reproductive evolution.  We also identify ovule limitation as a constraint on seed production, which has paradoxically not been recognized before, but is an implicit assumption of previous theoretical analysis of mating-system evolution.  Ovule limitation increases the diversity of possible reproductive policies.  In addition to ovule limitation, we consider the implications of pollen and resource limitation for the evolution of self- and cross-fertilization.  Resource limitation occurs only if plants produce more ovules than they can mature into seeds, which allows a mixture of selfing and outcrossing to be an optimal mating system in some circumstances.  The chance of mixed mating being optimal is eroded by trade-offs between self- and cross-pollination, but they do not alter the optimal combination of selfing and outcrossing, should mixed mating be favoured.  Our analysis illustrates the key role played by interactions between genetic and ecological influences on reproductive performance in the evolution of plant reproduction.</p>

        <div class="e-content">
         	<p>I recently lost control of my email. The combination of mailing lists, alerts, table of content notifications, and actual email from friends and colleagues was reaching a few hundred emails a day. The insanity had to stop! Here’s how I regained control.</p>

<h2>Goals</h2>

<p>Before describing my solution, let’s consider what a good email system should provide?</p>

<p><ul><li>Notifications of relevant new messages.</li>
<li>A process for keeping track of important and unanswered messages.</li>
<li>Automatic archiving with excellent search capabilities.</li>
<li>Portability and easy access.</li>
</ul><h2>Strategy</h2></p>

<p>I implemented my strategy as I switched to a <a href="http://mail.google.com">Gmail</a> account, which required that I catalogue and cancel all of my email subscriptions. Rather than re-subscribing to these, I redirected as many as possible to <a href="http://ranchero.com/netnewswire">NetNewsWire</a>. Many journals now provide feeds for their table of content alerts (e.g., <a href="http://www.nature.com/nature/newsfeeds.html">Nature</a>) and most of the important newsgroups are available through <a href="http://www.gmane.com/">Gmane</a>. The advantage of news feeds over email alerts is that I can easily group the alerts and choose when to refresh the subscriptions. Typically, I refresh my feed subscriptions in the morning as I caffeinate. I can simply flag important threads or articles for followup later if necessary and my Inbox is no longer cluttered.</p>

<p>Switching to Gmail also immediately solved several other issues with email. First, I no longer worry about storing and archiving email. All of it stays on Google’s servers. Second, this also solves the problem of deciding which messages to keep. Previously, for every new message I had to decide whether to delete it forever or store a copy. Although this only takes a few seconds for each message, when you receive hundreds of messages this can add up. Now, I don’t worry about it. I know that with the combination of Gmail’s search capabilities and my Mac’s <a href="http://www.apple.com/macosx/features/spotlight/">Spotlight</a> technology, I can find messages almost instantly. Third, Gmail is available from any webbrowser – now, so is my email.</p>

<p>That’s great so far, but I still have a variety of unfiltered email and I want to only be alerted to important or relevant messages. This is where <a href="http://www.apple.com/macosx/features/mail/">Mail.app’s</a> smart mailboxes and rules become important. The most important rule is that a message from someone who is not in my <a href="http://www.apple.com/macosx/features/addressbook/">Address Book</a> is immediately redirected out of my Inbox. I’ve also implemented a variety of <a href="http://mail.google.com/support/bin/answer.py?answer=12096&topic=1565">aliases</a> that allows easy filtering of email from my Inbox. All of these filtered messages are gathered together in a folder which I, generally, peruse once a day.</p>

<p>Now I’m left with an Inbox containing only messages from people that I know. As new mail arrives, any mail that survives my filters is sent to <a href="http://growl.info/">Growl</a> and an unobtrusive notification apprises me of the sender and subject. I can then choose to ignore the message if I’m busy or switch to Mail and read the message if it appears to be important.</p>

<p>As I process my messages, I implement the <a href="http://www.amazon.ca/exec/obidos/redirect?link_code=ur2&tag=matthewroutle-20&camp=15121&creative=330641&path=ASIN%2F0142000280%2Fqid%3D1133552449%2Fsr%3D8-1%2Fref%3Dsr_8_xs_ap_i1_xgl">GTD</a> workflow: if responding takes less than two minutes, I respond; otherwise, the message is flagged for follow-up. Finally, I have two smart mailboxes: flagged messages; and messages received today. Since I’ve asked Mail to group messages by thread, today’s messages also pull in all of my previous correspondence on the subject. Messages in these two mailboxes are what appear in my main message window. When I switch to Mail all I see are flagged, and therefore important, messages and current conversations.</p>

<p>This all may seem elaborate, but I find it works well.</p>

         	<p>The current setup at home is that I’ve added all of our music (several thousand songs) to our <a href="http://www.apple.com/macmini/">Mac Mini</a> and then send it through <a href="http://www.apple.com/airportexpress/airtunes.html">AirTunes</a> to the home stereo. The complication is that the stereo and computer are at opposite ends of the house. Ideally, I can use my <a href="http://www.apple.com/ibook">iBook</a> to control the Mac Mini without needing to walk down the hall, but how?</p>

<p>One solution is to use <a href="http://www.realvnc.com/">VNC</a>, which allows complete control of the Mac Mini. Essentially, the iBook becomes a remote keyboard, mouse, and display. However, I generally only want to either toggle iTunes between play and pause or skip to the next track. Loading up a VNC client and interacting with iTunes directly seems excessive in this case.</p>

<p>An alternate approach I have taken relies on a <a href="http://www.macdevcenter.com/pub/a/mac/collections/unix.html">Terminal session</a> and <a href="http://developer.apple.com/documentation/Darwin/Reference/ManPages/man1/osascript.1.html">osascript</a>. The first step is to log into the Mac Mini:</p>

<pre><code>$ ssh Nexus.local. -p 22
</code></pre>

<p>Then I can toggle between play and pause with:</p>

<pre><code>$ osascript -e 'tell application "itunes" to playpause'
</code></pre>

<p>or skip the current track with:</p>

<pre><code>$ osascript -e 'tell application "itunes" to nexttrack'
</code></pre>

<p>I keep the Terminal session active and have added the osascript commands to <a href="http://www.petermaurer.de/nasi.php?section=textpander">Textpander</a> so that I can quickly control iTunes remotely.</p>

<blockquote>KANSAS CITY, KS—As the debate over the teaching of evolution in public schools continues, a new controversy over the science curriculum arose Monday in this embattled Midwestern state. Scientists from the Evangelical Center For Faith-Based Reasoning are now asserting that the long-held &lsquo;theory of gravity&rsquo; is flawed, and they have responded to it with a new theory of Intelligent Falling.

'Things fall not because they are acted upon by some gravitational force, but because a higher intelligence, 'God&rsquo; if you will, is pushing them down,&rsquo; said Gabriel Burdett, who holds degrees in education, applied Scripture, and physics from Oral Roberts University&hellip;

Some evangelical physicists propose that Intelligent Falling provides an elegant solution to the central problem of modern physics.

'Anti-falling physicists have been theorizing for decades about the 'electromagnetic force,&rsquo; the 'weak nuclear force,&rsquo; the 'strong nuclear force,&rsquo; and so-called 'force of gravity,&rdquo; Burdett said. 'And they tilt their findings toward trying to unite them into one force. But readers of the Bible have already known for millennia what this one, unified force is: His name is Jesus.&rsquo;</blockquote>

         	<p>Mating by outcrossing plants depends on the frequency and quality of interaction between pollen vectors and individual flowers.  However, the historical focus of pollination biology on individual flowers (floricentrism) cannot produce a complete understanding of the role of pollination in plant mating, because mating is an aggregate process, which depends on the reproductive outcomes of all of a plant’s flowers.  Simultaneous display of multiple flowers in an inflorescence increases a plant’s attractiveness to pollinators, which should generally enhance mating opportunities.  However, whenever pollinators visit multiple flowers on an inflorescence, self-pollination among flowers can reduce the pollen available for export to other plants (pollen discounting) and increase the incidence of inbreeding depression for embryos and offspring.  Therefore, the size of floral displays that maximizes mating frequency and quality generally balances the benefits of attractiveness against the costs of self-pollination.  This balance can shift considerably if different flowers serve female and male functions at one time (sexual segregation) and flowers are arranged in inflorescences so that pollinators visit female flowers before male flowers.  However, the effectiveness of sexual segregation depends on the extent to which a particular inflorescence architecture induces consistent movement patterns by pollinators.  In general, the consistency of pollinator movement patterns varies with inflorescence architecture and differs between pollinator types.  Such variation creates many options for the evolution of the diverse inflorescence characteristics within angiosperms, which can be appreciated only by moving beyond a floricentric perspective of the role of pollination in plant mating.</p>

         	<p>Clonality is very common in flowering plants, but its consequences for sexual reproduction have rarely been explored. While clonal growth can increase the number of flowers a plant produces it may also limit reproductive success through pollen discounting (reduction in pollen exported to adjacent clones) and pollen limitation (failure of outside pollen to reach the centre of a clone). Using clones of domestic apple (Malus x domestica) that ranged from 1 to 5 orchard rows wide, we found that the patterns of siring success were consistent with the presence of pollen discounting, but we failed to detect evidence for pollen limitation. The results suggest that paternal function may be more sensitive to the effects of clonality than female function.</p>

        <div class="e-content">
         	<p>Dichogamy, the temporal separation of gender within a flower, is widespread throughout the angiosperms, occurring in over 250 families. There are two forms of dichogamy: protandry, in which male function precedes female function, and protogyny, the converse. Dichogamy has traditionally been interpreted as a mechanism to avoid inbreeding. However, recent evidence indicates that this inbreeding-avoidance hypothesis cannot completely explain the evolution of dichogamy. An alternate hypothesis is that dichogamy acts to reduce interference between gender functions. Interference can occur within a flower or between flowers on an inflorescence and result in substantial reductions in male and female reproductive success. To date there are very few tests of this interference-avoidance hypothesis or, in fact, investigations of the evolution of dichogamy in general. My Ph.D. thesis was a comprehensive evaluation of the evolutionary significance of dichogamy, including functional, genetic, comparative, and theoretical analyses of this important floral character.</p>

<p><img src="https://matt.routleynet.org/uploads/2019/02908cc8b7.jpg" width="250" height="331" alt="clint"/></p>

<p>This Claytonia species is protandrous. The flower on the left is in male phase with its anthers shedding pollen and the stigma closed and unreceptive. The flower on the right is approximately one day older and is in female phase. The stigma is open and receptive and the anthers have moved away to the side and are empty of pollen.</p>

<h2>Functional analyses</h2>

<p>As an evaluation of the fitness consequences of protandry, we tested the interference-avoidance hypothesis with enclosed, artificial populations of Chamerion angustifolium (Onagraceae) by experimentally manipulating protandry and inflorescence size and measuring pollinator visitation, seed set, female outcrossing-rate, and outcross siring-success. Protandrous plants had a marginally higher female outcrossing rate than adichogamous plants, but similar seed set and visitation rates. More importantly, protandrous plants (blue points) had, on average, a twofold siring advantage relative to adichogamous plants (red points). However, this siring advantage did not increase linearly with inflorescence size, suggesting that protandry acts to enhance siring success, but not exclusively by reducing between-flower interference.</p>

<p><img src="https://matt.routleynet.org/uploads/2019/885b748f18.jpg" width="500" height="458" alt="siring"/></p>

<p>To better understand the function of protandry, we analyzed single bee visits to pairs of C. angustifolium flowers in the field and the lab. The patterns of pollen removal and deposition revealed two major consequences of simultaneous hermaphroditism. First, the presence of anthers impeded pollinator’s access to the stigma. Second, pollinators spent more time foraging on hermaphroditic flowers, relative to female flowers. Protandry allows pollen to be exported in the absence of this within-flower interference and can enhance both male and female reproductive success through reductions in pollen discounting and facilitated selfing, respectively.</p>

<p><img src="https://matt.routleynet.org/uploads/2019/eb7545a393.jpg" width="400" height="299" alt="beevisit"/></p>

<h2>Genetic analysis</h2>

<p>The genetic basis of dichogamy may have important implications for its evolution. Consequently, we conducted genetic analyses of protandry in C. angustifolium using a paternal half-sib design and an artificial selection experiment. We found moderate heritability (h^2^=0.27) for the duration of male phase. An analysis of plants from the artificial selection experiment showed no genetic correlation between male-phase duration and aspects of floral size. However, we estimated a positive genetic correlation between male-phase duration and floral display size. In addition, we detected a negative correlation between male- and female-phase durations which creates the opportunity for fitness trade-offs between male and female function.</p>

<p><img src="https://matt.routleynet.org/uploads/2019/65f28c4282.jpg" width="464" height="442" alt="sel"/></p>

<h2>Phylogenetic analysis</h2>

<p>To gain a broader perspective on the evolution of dichogamy, we used a current, well resolved phylogeny of the angiosperms to conduct a comparative analysis of dichogamy and self-incompatibility. Using paired-comparisons and maximum-likelihood correlation analyses, we found that protandry is positively correlated with self-incompatibility and protogyny with self-compatibility. These results support a role for interference avoidance in the evolution of protandry and inbreeding avoidance in the evolution of protogyny, suggesting that the two forms of dichogamy provide different functions. In addition, dichogamy changes character states throughout the phylogeny, allowing rapid responses to changing ecological circumstance.</p>

<p><img src="https://matt.routleynet.org/uploads/2019/3de9902b7b.jpg" width="500" height="375" alt="phylo"/></p>

<h2>Theoretical analysis</h2>

<p>We developed a conceptual model to synthesize the effects of male-phase duration, inflorescence size, and inbreeding depression on pollen import and export. The relative fitness of protandry is strongly affected by the combination of floral display size and inbreeding depression. Furthermore, the trade-off between male- and female-phase durations produced a fitness landscape much more favourable to the evolution of protandry.</p>

<p><img src="https://matt.routleynet.org/uploads/2019/1eafaacb9c.jpg" width="451" height="366" alt="relfitness"/></p>

<h2>Conclusions</h2>

<p>Collectively, this research suggest that protandry enhances male fitness through reductions in both within- and between-flower interference, while protogyny reduces inbreeding. This work has revealed unexpected fitness benefits to protandry and helps to explain the wide taxonomic and ecological distribution of this trait in flowering plants.</p>

         	<p>The outcrossing rate is a fundamental attribute of plant populations that determines population genetic structure, individual plant fitness, and ultimately speciation rates. The outcrossing rate can be influenced by population size through reductions in both mate availability and pollinator service. We investigated the effect of population size on the outcrossing rate in 10 populations of Aquilegia canadensis in Southern Ontario, Canada.</p>

<p>Across a range of sizes from 32 to 750 reproductive individuals, we found that small populations (n < 35, red line) had a significantly lower outcrossing rate than large populations (n > 90, blue line).</p>

<p>Given the high estimate for inbreeding depression in this species (0.88 ± 0.14), small populations may experience a rapid decline in population-level fitness that can lead to local extirpation. The consequences of human-induced habitat fragmentation suggest that such local extinctions are common due to this demographic effect.</p>

         	<p>As I use <a href="http://www.r-project.org/">R</a> for data analysis and simulations, I become more comfortable and proficient with the R/S syntax and style of programming. One important insight is the use of vector assignments in simulations. I have often read that using such assignments is the preferred method, but until recently I had not realised the importance of this statement. To illustrate the use of vector assignments and their advantages, consider two models of the style illustrated below:</p>

<p>Model 1:</p>

<pre><code> value1List <- seq(1:10)
 value2Function <- function (value1) {
     ifelse(value1 < constant1, constant2, constant1)
 }
 tableDimension <- length(value1List)
 outputTable <- NULL
 outputTable <- data.frame(value1=numeric(tableDimension), 
 value2=numeric(tableDimension))
 n <- 1
 for (value1 in value1List) {
     outputTable[n, ] <- c(value1, value2Function(value1))
     n <- n + 1
 }
</code></pre>

<p>Model 2:</p>

<pre><code> value1List <- seq(1:10)
 tableDimension <- length(value1List)
 outputTable <- NULL
 outputTable$value1 <- rep(value1List, each=
     tableDimension / (length(value1List)))
 outputTable <- as.data.frame(outputTable)
 outputTable$value2 <- ifelse(value1 < constant1, constant2, constant1)
</code></pre>

<p>Model 1 is how I originally approached R programming. It begins with declaration of a sequence for value1 and a function declaration to calculate value2 from each value1. I then declare a table to capture the output and fill it with zero values. The main loop of the program consists of replacing the rows of the output table with each value of value1 and the calculated value2. I use the variable n to keep track of the next row in the table. The function rbind() could also be used to generate the table, but it’s use for large datasets is quite inefficient.</p>

<p>Model 2 takes the approach of constructing each column of the output table in sequence. It begins by repeating the values of the value1List and then creates the value2 column through a vector assignment. No control structures or function calls are required in Model 2.</p>

<p>How is this important? Model 1 seems intuitive (at least to me) while the syntax of Model 2 is opaque at first glance. However, consider this figure:
<img src="https://matt.routleynet.org/uploads/2019/de6dc42431.png" width="377" height="365" alt="vectorR"/></p>

<p>On the x-axis is the number of data points in the output table on a log scale. The y-axis shows how long the model takes to calculate these values. Model 1 is the blue line. Model 2 is the red line. This illustrates two important points:
 * Model 1 is always slower than Model 2.
 * As the size of the dataset increases, Model 2 remains fast while Model 1 rapidly consumes all of the computer resources.</p>

<p>This is why vector assignments should be used when programming with R. Just to be clear, the models described here are simple abstractions of the types of models used to generate this figure.</p>

         	<p>A recent column in the <a href="http://www.theglobeandmail.com/">Globe & Mail</a> reminded me of our Federal Government’s plan for reducing greenhouse gas emissions: the <a href="http://www.climatechange.gc.ca/onetonne/english/index.asp">One Tonne Challenge</a>.</p>

<p>This campaign challenges each Canadian to reduce their contribution to greenhouse gas emissions by one tonne. The first step is to calculate your emissions and then implement recommendations for reductions. According to the online calculator, Kelly & I combined emit 4.23 tonnes annually. Fortunately, this is below the national average of 5.5 tonnes per person and significantly better than Alberta’s average of 8 tonnes per person. Still, we could do better. However, the suggestions provided aren’t much help. They largely concern implementing energy savings to our home — which we rent and have little control over. Here are the suggestions I could implement:</p>

<p><ul><li>Take a 5-minute shower instead of a bath.</li>
    <li>Turn off lights when a room is not in use.</li>
    <li>Use a cold water wash and rinse instead of warm or hot water to wash your clothes.</li>
    <li>Replace standard light bulbs with compact fluorescent light bulbs where lights are on for three or more hours at a time.</li>
</ul><p>The <a href="http://www.climatechange.gc.ca/onetonne/english/index.asp">website</a> has a variety of good suggestions. The trick is convincing Canadian’s to assume some responsibility for climate change. Monetary incentives seem like the best strategy, but those are not currently under consideration.</p></p>

        <div class="e-content">
         	<p>Plants are sessile and, consequently, many species rely on pollinators for mating opportunities. However, pollinators do not necessarily visit every individual in a population with equal frequency. Plant attributes, such as floral display and reward provisioning, can influence the frequency of pollinator visitation. Furthermore, aspects of population density and structure may also influence visitation patterns. One effect of this unequal distribution of pollinator activity is that pollinators create networks of connections between plants in which a few plant receive many visits and many plants receive few visits. Such networks are termed ‘scale-free’ and can be contrasted with random networks. Random networks follow a Poisson distribution of connection frequency and have the familiar bell shape characteristic of many biological patterns. Scale-free networks have power-law distributions with no peak, just a steady decline in the frequency of nodes with increasing number of connections. Technically, in a scale-free network the probability that any node is connected to k other nodes is proportional to 1/k^n^, where n is usually around 2.</p>

<h3>Measuring networks</h3>

<p>The hallmark of a scale-free network is a hub or node with a high number of connections. A relatively simple test for hubs is to plot a histogram of the number of connections between plants. This is illustrated in the following figures. On the left, many plants have a low frequency of connections, while a few plants have many connections. Those plants with many connections could be hubs. Contrast this with the right. The distribution of connections follows a bell shape with no plants having an excessive number of connections. There are no hub plants in this population.</p>

<p><img src="https://matt.routleynet.org/uploads/2019/fdae864422.jpg" alt="Example network"/></p>

<h3>Importance of scale-free networks</h3>

<p>The analysis of scale-free networks has provided insights into fields as diverse as scientific-citation patterns, disease epidemics, world-wide-web structure, and cellular metabolism. Such power suggests that applying network thinking to pollination biology may be useful. These networks are produced through a process of growth and unequal creation of connections. Clearly plant populations experience changes in population size and pollinator behaviour often leads to 'traplining’ or enhanced visitation to particular phenotypes. Consequently, plant populations have some of the prerequisites for scale-free networks. Scale-free networks are very resilient to the random loss of nodes, because the vast majority of network function is provided by the hubs. In a plant population context, if a population can be characterised by a power-law distribution, population growth rates and persistence are likely driven by a small subset of the plants. Such an asymmetry would have important implications for evolutionary ecology and conservation questions.</p>

<p>An important first step is to determine if pollinator-visitation patterns follow a power-law distribution. Hub plants could then be identified and the mechanisms producing the pattern investigated. Are hubs spatially clustered? Do they have larger-than-average floral displays or brighter floral pigments? What are the demographic consequences of removing hubs from a plant population? All we need is data on pollinator visits to plant populations. The data I have access to are inconclusive, mostly because they have insufficient visit frequencies. Any other data sets would be appreciated.</p>

         	<p>Until recently, I was able to use journal abbreviations in all of my manuscripts. Consequently, my .bib file contains only abbreviations in the journal field.

There are two types of substitution rules to handle some abbreviation conflicts (for example, Ecol. could be Ecology or Ecological). The first set of rules takes precedence over the second.</p>

<p>Rather than maintain two .bib files, I decided to use the abbreviated file as the main file and then periodically replace the long-journals file. The script could be improved to make it more flexible, but I only maintain one .bib file so it made sense to hardcode the file names and replacement arrays in the script. The copy linked to above has most of the substitution rules removed, since I assume they are not generally useful.</p>

<p>Suggestions are appreciated. Be sure to test out the script with a backup database first. Changes are not undoable.</p>

         	<p>I have been investigating issues of ovule and seed development recently. One question that has come up is: How much variation is there in seed size? I had analysed some seed set data for some <a href="http://pmbrowser.info/pmdisplay.cgi?issn=00143820&uids=12683521">earlier work</a> with some image analysis software. Consequently I have a large data set of seed area and perimeter for Chamerion angustifolium. A rough look at the data is:</p>

<p><img src="https://matt.routleynet.org/uploads/2019/39d13596ba.png" width="598" height="573" alt="seedSize"/></p>

<p>The data set is available as <a href="http://public.me.com/mroutley/">seedSizeData.txt.zip</a>. Bewarned, the file contains over 100,000 lines – be sure to use an efficient text editor or stats package. All dimensions are in cm. The seed? column contains a 1 for seeds and 2 for objects smaller than seeds. See <a href="http://pmbrowser.info/pmdisplay.cgi?issn=00143820&uids=12683521">this</a> for details.</p>

         	<p><a href="http://www.amazon.ca/exec/obidos/ASIN/0691034974/matthewroutle-20">The Ecological Detective</a> by Ray Hilborn and Marc Mangel is an excellent source for learning how to analyse ecological data with sophistication. Traditionally, ecological data is analysed from the binary perspective of hypothesis testing. The goal of such testing is to either accept or reject a null hypothesis. Although it is well entrenched in ecological training and publication, this hypothesis testing has repeatedly been attacked by <a href="http://links.jstor.org/sici?sici=0035-9254%281996%2945%3A4%3C401%3AAASC%3E2.0.CO%3B2-0">statisticians</a> and many <a href="http://www.npwrc.usgs.gov/resource/1999/statsig/statsig.htm">ecologists</a>.</p>

<p>Without entering into this debate now, Hilborn and Mangel present an alternative of constructing models of the biological system of interest and then testing the model with collected data. This approach offers a much more nuanced and powerful way of understanding ecological processes. No longer is the ecology simply used to accept or reject a null hypothesis. Rather, a deeper understanding is required that leads to greater insights into the process.</p>

<p>As part of reading through the Ecological Detective, I worked through the pseudo-code examples provided and implemented them in <a href="http://wolfram.com/">Mathematica</a>. I’’ve decided to make these files available: <a href="http://public.me.com/mroutley/EcologicalDetective.zip">EcologicalDetective.zip</a>. My hope is that someone else will find them useful. I would be particularly interested in discussing these files and the book with anyone interested. I should point out that this was my first use of Mathematica, so I would appreciate any feedback on how to use it more effectively.</p>

        <div class="e-content">
         	<p>In some recent research (<a href="http://public.me.com/mroutley/SIandDichogamy.pdf">http://public.me.com/mroutley/SIandDichogamy.pdf</a>) I had to make inferences about families based on character states of the species within the family. One approach is to use a simple majority rule. For example, if more than half of the species possess character state x rather than y, then the family can be described as x. However, this approach seemed rather liberal, which led to a 2/3 majority criterion: if more than 2/3 of the species are x, the family is x; If less than 1/3 is x the family is y; otherwise the family is ambiguous.</p>

<p>A significant drawback to arbitrarily creating such criteria is that I had no idea what the consequences were for making Type I and Type II errors. Presumably, as the criterion becomes more stringent, Type I errors are less likely, but such uncertainty is not comforting. I decided a better approach would be to attempt a simulation study using different criteria coupled with a more sophisticated character state reconstruction algorithm.</p>

<p>The general approach was to create a family of twenty species and randomly assign a fixed proportion of each species one of two possible character states. The fixed probability chosen represented the decision criteria to be evaluated. For example, a 51% proportion is equivalent to the simple majority criterion. I then randomly generated 5,000 phylogenetic tree topologies for the family. To evaluate any given decision criterion, I compared the family characterization from the decision criterion to the ancestral-state reconstruction from <a href="http://links.jstor.org/sici?sici=0014-3820%28199712%2951%3A6%3C1699%3ALOASIA%3E2.0.CO%3B2-4">Schluter et al’s</a> maximum-likelihood analysis. The idea is that the maximum-likelihood reconstruction should be reasonably accurate, since it incorporates tree topology into its calculations. If the decision criterion and maximum-likelihood approaches yield similar answers, the decision criterion may be a good choice for describing families in the absence of species-level phylogenetic resolution.</p>

<p>I tested three decision criteria. Their results are: an 80% criterion was 98.1% accurate, 65% was 91.6%, and 55% was 60.8%. Clearly more stringent criteria are most similar to the more sophisticated maximum-likelihood analyses. However, stringency does exclude more data from the analysis as more families become ambiguously coded. A proper trade-off between stringency and sample size is required to make the best use of data.</p>

<p>I conducted these simulations with <a href="http://www.mesquiteproject.org">Mesquite</a> and the data file is available(<a href="http://public.me.com/mroutley/simulations.nex">http://public.me.com/mroutley/simulations.nex</a>).</p>

        <div class="e-content">
         	<p>I have been working through my references and papers trying to regain some control over the literature. Being reintroduced to the tedium of reference management, it seems like there must be a better way to catalogue and organize this important component of research. Ideally, with the Internet and some good citation support from publishers, I would never have to type a citation – just automagically download whatever I need. Obviously this is not currently available.</p>

<p>I use <a href="http://bibdesk.sourceforge.net/">BibDesk</a> for my reference management and the <a href="http://michael-mccracken.net/blog/">author</a> has some interesting ideas about sharing reference databases easily among colleagues. In this spirit of sharing, I’’ve decided to make my reference database available <a href="/files/References.bib">here</a>. It is in <a href="http://www.ecst.csuchico.edu/~jacobsd/bib/formats/bibtex.html">BibTeX</a> format, which most useful reference management software should recognize. As BibDesk matures I hope to make this database accessible in a more useful format (i.e., automatic synchronization). Until then I will update the publicly available database as often as possible. Ideally the database will become a group effort, maintained and expanded by whoever uses it. If you are interested in participating, let me know. There are some fields in the database that may not be useful. In particular, there is a link to the PDF location on my harddrive. I considered transfering these links and associated files to the Internet as well. However, there are copyright concerns with such a setup that need to be considered.</p>

        <div class="e-content">
         	<p>Unrelated to my “official” thesis work, I have been thinking about floral form and its influence on plant fitness. As an excuse to start a discussion with anyone interested, I’ve posted this overview of what I hope to work on next.</p>

<p>Plant mating systems control the transmission of genes between generations and, therefore, are a fundamental characteristic of populations. Since flowers are the reproductive organs of plants, floral form fundamentally influences plant mating systems. However, research into floral evolution has traditionally “atomized” flowers into conspicuous traits that are then investigated independently. Despite the undeniable success of this reductionist approach, an alternate research strategy called phenotypic integration, found at the intersection of morphometrics, quantitative genetics, reproductive ecology, and plant evolution, offers a unique perspective. Floral integration, in particular, asserts that the variance-covariance structure of entire flowers, rather than mean values of individual traits, may be an important target for selection. This is especially relevant for animal-pollinated, hermaphroditic flowers (i.e., most angiosperms) in which the male and female sexual organs must be positioned precisely within the path of pollen movement. Consequently, I expect high integration for anther and stigma placement relative to, for example, vegetative characters. After a long period of neglect, floral integration is beginning to receive more attention. To date, most of this research has focussed on quantifying the magnitude of integration, whereas the evolutionary significance of variation in floral integration remains an open question.</p>
