        <p>As a benchmark for upcoming training, my coach had me run a 5k time trial. This is also useful for determining my heart rate training zones üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è</p>

        <span class="post-date">Jan 8, 2022

</span>
        <p>As an experiment, I spent the past week listening only to the <a href="https://www.macstories.net/stories/a-comprehensive-guide-to-250-of-apple-musics-new-mood-and-activity-playlists/">Activity Playlists in Apple Music</a>. So, whatever I was doing, I picked the most closely related playlist.</p>

<p>Often these were straightforward. Cooking dinner with help from the kids: <a href="https://music.apple.com/us/playlist/cooking-with-family/pl.5f59cffdd4644040bed2b7562d83f270">Cooking with Family</a>; triaging the morning inbox of email: <a href="https://music.apple.com/us/playlist/checking-email/pl.f323a401141748cfb74e08ef2f98193f">Checking Email</a>; mind mapping a project: <a href="https://music.apple.com/us/playlist/brainstorming/pl.acf4e6669fbd4baba50e249d57db5a61">Brainstorming</a>.</p>

<p>Other times it was more mood oriented. Reading by the fire when it is -20¬∫C: <a href="https://music.apple.com/us/playlist/winter/pl.8b36c21d1ce7493392a2f845c4293408">Winter</a>; augmenting an early Wednesday morning coffee: <a href="https://music.apple.com/us/playlist/wake-me-up/pl.c79a0c8eac46444ea8058d68008ba2d4">Wake Me Up!</a>.</p>

<p>Overall, the playlists are good.</p>

<p>The ones I listened to are meaningfully distinct from each other and the song choices do match the general mood of the activity. Just as one example, although their names are quite close, I did get different vibes from the <a href="https://music.apple.com/us/playlist/deep-focus/pl.556863bb540c4651b6196bf82e2a3bb9">Deep Focus</a>, <a href="https://music.apple.com/us/playlist/peaceful-focus/pl.9b8a976ba78741d9925e6e9a050703de">Peaceful Focus</a>, and <a href="https://music.apple.com/us/playlist/creative-focus/pl.4351e59aabd44f73a7b2a832020acc55">Creative Focus</a> playlists.</p>

<p>In general the song choices are, not surprisingly, oriented towards the pop genres. That said, they aren‚Äôt just a collection of current hits. Playlists include some old gems and more obscure songs. Clearly, the songs were chosen with care and not strictly driven by machine learning algorithms.</p>

<p>One unanticipated side effect of this was that the rest of the family noted how much better the music was in the kitchen. No more of that ‚Äúweird Dad music‚Äù üôÑ. I take some consolation in the knowledge that in about ten years they‚Äôll rediscover and appreciate these ‚Äúclassic songs‚Äù and finally realize that, in fact, I do have good musical tastes.</p>

<p>Although the music is generally good, discoverability is terrible. MacStories <a href="https://www.macstories.net/stories/a-comprehensive-guide-to-250-of-apple-musics-new-mood-and-activity-playlists/">pointed this out</a> and created a very helpful Shortcut for grouping and playing these playlists. Even when you select ‚ÄúSee All‚Äù from the Just Ask Siri section, Apple Music shows some random selection of the playlists. I haven‚Äôt noticed any particular pattern of which ones are displayed and can‚Äôt understand why Apple is making it so difficult to browse them. Maybe they‚Äôre still experimenting?</p>

<p>I never did find reasons to listen to many of the playlists, like the whole series for Zodiac signs or the one for <a href="https://music.apple.com/us/playlist/square-dancing/pl.81be3a937c8f416391f8c13ca38ae5f9">square dancing</a>. This just shows the diversity of playlists available and, again, points out the problem with discoverability.</p>

<p>This was a successful experiment that forced me to actually experience the feature. That said, I wouldn‚Äôt want to continue relying on only these playlists. I‚Äôll keep using them when I can‚Äôt be bothered to carefully choose an album or playlist and just want something appropriate to the mood or activity, which surely is the whole point of them anyway.</p>

        <h1 class="post-title"><a href="https://matt.routleynet.org/2022/01/04/my-first-swimming.html">My first swimming workout üèä‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è</a></h1>
        <span class="post-date">Jan 4, 2022

</span>
        <p>I‚Äôve been in a pool with my Apple Watch before, though only either to splash around with the kids or with a beer at an all-inclusive resort. Today was the first time I‚Äôve used it for an actual swimming workout. It has also been a long time since my high school swimming days back in the early 90s. So, an important day!</p>

<p>My coach gave me a straightforward workout:</p>

<ul>
<li>Warm up 2 x 50m and 4 x 25m</li>
<li>Main set 10 x 50m with 20s rest and 10 x 25m with 20s rest</li>
<li>2 x 100m with 1 min rest</li>
</ul>

<p>As expected, using the Apple Watch was simple. When you start up the workout, it asks for the length of the pool and then automatically figures out when you stop for a rest. This shows up in the ‚ÄúAuto Sets‚Äù in the screenshot below. Based on this, it looks like my rests were longer than planned, though I‚Äôm not entirely sure how precise these are and when it decides to start and stop. Something to keep an eye on next time.</p>

<p><img src="https://matt.routleynet.org/uploads/2022/42fa89b3ac.png" alt="Screenshots from the Apple Fitness app of a swimming workout" /></p>

<p>I enjoyed being in the pool again and my muscle memory seemed to return. Way back in high school, I specialized in the 1,500m and was very familiar with the seemingly endless flip turns of a pool swim. One thing I need to work on is breath control. I‚Äôve gotten very used to just breathing whenever I want and had some trouble getting in three strokes before breathing near the end of the workout. No doubt this will improve with practice.</p>

<p>I also need to work on my wardrobe. I was the only one in the pool wearing board shorts and no swim cap üòÄ</p>

        <h1 class="post-title"><a href="https://matt.routleynet.org/2022/01/03/time-to-stop.html">Time to stop tracking my personal life ‚è∞</a></h1>
        <span class="post-date">Jan 3, 2022

</span>
        <p>Through 2020, I built up an ornate system for tracking my time for both work and personal projects (like <a href="https://matt.routleynet.org/2020/07/26/reading-shortcut-for.html">this one for reading</a>). For most of 2021, I found this tracking really helpful.</p>

<p>I need to track my hours at work anyway, so using <a href="https://timeryapp.com">Timery</a> and Shortcuts to automate much of this has been great. Having a strong sense of how long things take and ensuring good balance across projects are all benefits of time tracking.</p>

<p>For personal projects, though, I‚Äôve been starting to feel a bit stressed by having a timer always running whenever I‚Äôm doing something, almost like I‚Äôm always in a race. At first, knowing how much time I was spending on particular things was great for my <a href="https://matt.routleynet.org/2020/12/28/year-of-the.html">Year of the Tangible intention</a>. This is well established now, and I haven‚Äôt been using the time reports for any personal projects. So, why am I creating anxiety for no benefit?</p>

<p>I‚Äôve turned off all of my time tracking automations for personal projects. Despite some <a href="https://matt.routleynet.org/2021/12/14/i-really-like.html">annoying bugs</a>, ScreenTime is a good-enough replacement for keeping an eye on time spent on things like YouTube and social networking. A nice side benefit is that this also reduces the number of Shortcuts and other automation that I need to manage, allowing me to just enjoy my personal time.</p>

<p>Of course, I‚Äôll keep tracking work projects, since the benefits far outweigh the costs there.</p>

        <p>This seems to be the consensus, so I won&rsquo;t belabour the point: <a href="https://micro.blog/books/9780374159122">Four Thousand Weeks</a> by Oliver Burkeman is a powerful book. If you feel overwhelmed by busyness or slightly adrift, it is well worth a read. There are some tough messages in it, though, that require contemplation üìö</p>

        <p>As an update to my <a href="https://matt.routleynet.org/2019/10/15/task-management-with.html">earlier post about using MindNode for task management</a>, I‚Äôve refreshed my areas of focus and projects for work. I still find MindNode really helpful for this, especially for seeing the balance of projects across the areas of focus. In this case, I can see that I have many Process Improvement projects, which makes sense, given my company has a big push on Lean at the moment.</p>

<p><img src="uploads/2021/28d3dee5d9.png" width="450" alt="Screenshot of areas of focus and projects as a mindmap in MindNode" /></p>

<p>Now I can fill in next actions for each project and then sync with Reminders.</p>

        <p><a href="https://micro.blog/books/9780061796883">The Dispossessed</a> by Ursula K.
