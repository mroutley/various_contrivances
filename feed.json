				"content_html": "<p>When I ran a marathon several years ago, my training plan was just to go for countless long runs. Now that I’m older and wiser, I’m going to be more sophisticated in training for <a href=\"https://matt.routleynet.org/2021/12/14/after-likely-too.html\">Tremblant</a> and that means getting a good coach.</p>\n\n<p>The first question any potential coach has asked is: what is my goal for the race? This is a helpful first sign, since their approach to my training really should be based on my goal. Plus, it has been a good motivator for me to actually share my goal out loud, which helps me think it through.</p>\n\n<p>My goal is to simply finish, while enjoying the race. I’m not aiming for any podium. Although I know it will be tough — the challenge is part of the point, after all — I want to avoid crawling across the finish line, bruised and battered after a long grind. My broader purpose is to use the event as a good excuse to keep active and try out new things. I hope that I’ll be doing events like this for the next decade or so. If the training burns me out or causes injuries, in the pursuit of some unattainable ranking at the event, we’ve missed this purpose.</p>\n\n<p>I’ve also been thinking through what I’m looking for in a coach. There are lots of potentially valid approaches to coaching. I need to find one that aligns with my needs and expectations. In general, there are three things, in order, that I’m looking for.</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Knowledge: There’s so much to learn! As I said at the beginning, there’s the training plan that mixes all three sports in the right amounts without causing injury. There’s also sorting out nutrition for the race to keep energy optimized. And gear (so much gear!) from bikes to wetsuits and apps to goggles. Without good advice, I could waste a lot of money on shiny, unnecessary gadgets. A seasoned coach can help with all of this.</li>\n<li>Community: I’m generally autonomous and would naturally orient towards doing much of my training solo. Despite this, I joined a running group about a month ago and have really enjoyed the camaraderie and support. So, I’ll be looking to a coach to help get me connected with the local community, especially for the cycling. Long-distance rides will be much better with other people.</li>\n<li>Accountability: I think I’m pretty goal oriented and persistent (some would say stubborn). I don’t yet know if this will persist over 6 months with significantly more training. Having a coach track my progress, adjusting where necessary, will help keep me honest and on target.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Hopefully, not too much to ask for!</p>\n",

Plus, it has been a good motivator for me to actually share my goal out loud, which helps me think it through.\n\nMy goal is to simply finish, while enjoying the race. I’m not aiming for any podium. Although I know it will be tough — the challenge is part of the point, after all — I want to avoid crawling across the finish line, bruised and battered after a long grind. My broader purpose is to use the event as a good excuse to keep active and try out new things. I hope that I’ll be doing events like this for the next decade or so. If the training burns me out or causes injuries, in the pursuit of some unattainable ranking at the event, we’ve missed this purpose.\n\nI’ve also been thinking through what I’m looking for in a coach. There are lots of potentially valid approaches to coaching. I need to find one that aligns with my needs and expectations. In general, there are three things, in order, that I’m looking for.\n\n1. Knowledge: There’s so much to learn! As I said at the beginning, there’s the training plan that mixes all three sports in the right amounts without causing injury. There’s also sorting out nutrition for the race to keep energy optimized. And gear (so much gear!) from bikes to wetsuits and apps to goggles. Without good advice, I could waste a lot of money on shiny, unnecessary gadgets. A seasoned coach can help with all of this.\n2. Community: I’m generally autonomous and would naturally orient towards doing much of my training solo. Despite this, I joined a running group about a month ago and have really enjoyed the camaraderie and support. So, I’ll be looking to a coach to help get me connected with the local community, especially for the cycling. Long-distance rides will be much better with other people.\n3. Accountability: I think I’m pretty goal oriented and persistent (some would say stubborn). I don’t yet know if this will persist over 6 months with significantly more training. Having a coach track my progress, adjusting where necessary, will help keep me honest and on target.\n\nHopefully, not too much to ask for!\n\n\n",

I’ve found these checks very unreliable. Sometimes the Shortcut finds the match and appends, and sometimes it doesn’t and creates a new one. Part of the problem seems to be that if there’s any punctuation in the content, the Notes filter fails.

I choose from the list and it creates a meeting note, starts a Timery timer, and opens the link to start the video call (typically Teams). The meeting note has the name of the meeting as the title, adds tags for #meeting and the Timery project, adds the date and time of the meeting, a list of attendees, and any notes from the calendar event.

Often a good third of my analytical scripts are devoted to accessing and processing data from the Statistics Canada website, which always seems like a waste of effort and good opportunity for making silly errors. So, I was keen to test out the [`cansim`package](https://mountainmath.github.io/cansim/index.html) for R to see how it might help. The quick answer is \"very much\".\n\nThe [documentation](https://mountainmath.github.io/cansim/articles/cansim.html) for the `cansim` package is thorough and doesn't need to be repeated here. I thought it might be useful to illustrate how helpful the package can be by refactoring [some earlier work](https://matt.routleynet.org/2020/01/10/things-cost-more.html) that explored consumer price inflation.\n\nThese scripts always start off with downloading and extracting the relevant data file:\n\n```\ncpi_url <- \"https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/n1/tbl/csv/18100004-eng.zip\" # (1)\nif(file.exists(\"18100004-eng.zip\")) { # (2)\n    # Already downloaded\n  }  else {\n    download.file(cpi_url,\n      destfile = \"18100004-eng.zip\", \n      quiet = TRUE)\n    unzip(\"18100004-eng.zip\") # (3)\n  }\ncpi <- readr::read_csv(\"18100004.csv\") # (4)\n```\n A few things to note here:\n\n1. You need to know the url for the data. Sometimes the logic is clear and you can guess, but often that doesn't work and you need to spelunk through the Stats Can website\n2. To avoid downloading the file every time I run the script, there's a test to see if the file already exists\n3. This approach yields lots of files and folders that you need to manage, including making sure they're ignored by version control\n4. Using the great `readr` package imports the final csv file\n\nWith `cansim` all I need to know is the data series number:\n\n```\ncansim_table <- \"18-10-0004\"\ncpi <- cansim::get_cansim(cansim_table)\n```\n\n`get_cansim`downloads the right file to a temporary directory, extracts the data, and imports it as a `tidyverse`-compatible data frame.\n\nThe `get_cansim` function has some other nice features.

It should not even, really, be thought of as means to make an inference (although, it is in the most simplistic interpretation of the Neyman-Pearson paradigm). It is, instead, a means to critique a potential inference.\n",

These are all automatically populated, based on anticipated use and have been quite prescient.\n\n![](https://matt.routleynet.org/uploads/2020/72f02dbcc4.jpg)\n\nMy second screen is all widgets with views from apps that I want to have always available. Although the dynamic content on the first screen has been really good, I do want some certainty about accessing specific content. This second screen replaces how I was using the [Today View](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT207122). I'm not really sure what to do with that feature anymore.\n\n![](https://matt.routleynet.org/uploads/2020/2b15519038.jpg)\n\nI've hidden all of the other screens and rely on the App Library and search to find anything else.\n\nI still like the simplicity behind my earlier approach to the Home Screen. We'll see if that is just what I'm used to. This new approach is worth testing out for at least a few weeks.\n",

				"content_html": "<p>I&rsquo;m delivering a seminar on estimating capital costs for large transit projects soon. One of the main concepts that seems to confuse people is inflation (including the non-intuitive terms nominal and real costs). To guide this discussion, I&rsquo;ve pulled <a href=\"https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/n1/daily-quotidien/191218/dq191218a-eng.htm\">data from Statistics Canada</a> on the Consumer Price Index (CPI) to make a few points.</p>\n\n<p>The first point is that, yes, things do cost more than they used to, since prices have consistently increased year over year (this is the <a href=\"https://www.bankofcanada.ca/core-functions/monetary-policy/\">whole point</a> of monetary policy). I&rsquo;m illustrating this with a long-term plot of CPI in Canada from 1914-01-01 to 2019-11-01.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"uploads/2020/deee8a906e.jpg\" width=\"600\" alt=\"Figure showing the long-term increase in CPI from 1914 to 2019.

				"content_text": "I'm delivering a seminar on estimating capital costs for large transit projects soon. One of the main concepts that seems to confuse people is inflation (including the non-intuitive terms nominal and real costs). To guide this discussion, I've pulled [data from Statistics Canada](https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/n1/daily-quotidien/191218/dq191218a-eng.htm) on the Consumer Price Index (CPI) to make a few points.\n\nThe first point is that, yes, things do cost more than they used to, since prices have consistently increased year over year (this is the [whole point](https://www.bankofcanada.ca/core-functions/monetary-policy/) of monetary policy). I'm illustrating this with a long-term plot of CPI in Canada from 1914-01-01 to 2019-11-01.\n\n<img src=\"uploads/2020/deee8a906e.jpg\" width=\"600\" alt=\"Figure showing the long-term increase in CPI from 1914 to 2019.

Even if this isn&rsquo;t quite right for you, I&rsquo;d encourage you to take a few minutes to really think through how you interact with your phone.

Anything that I want to keep gets moved into Apple Notes.\n\n[Things][] is on the left and is currently my favoured todo app. All of my tasks, projects, and areas of focus are in there, tagged by context, and given due dates, if appropriate. If the Things app has a notification badge, then I’ve got work to do today. If you’re keen, The Sweet Setup has a great [course][] on Things.\n\nA few more notes on my setup:\n\n* If Drafts isn’t the right place to start, I just pull down from the home screen to activate search and find the right app. I’ve found that the [Siri Suggestions][ss] are often what I’m looking for (based on time of day and other context).\n* Some apps are more important for their output than input. These include [calendar][], [weather][], and [notes][]. I’ve set these up as [widgets in the Today View][widgets]. A quick slide to the right reveals these.\n* I interact with several other apps through notifications, particularly for communication with Messages and Mail. But, I’ve set up VIPs in Mail to reduce these notifications to just the really important people.\n\nI've been using this setup for a few months now and it certainly works for me. Even if this isn't quite right for you, I'd encourage you to take a few minutes to really think through how you interact with your phone. I see far too many people with the default settings spending too much time scrolling around on their phones looking for the right app.\n\n[drafts]: https://getdrafts.com\n[things]: https://culturedcode.com/things/\n[widgets]: https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT207122\n[course]: https://thesweetsetup.com/things/\n[calendar]: https://flexibits.com/fantastical\n[weather]: https://www.meetcarrot.com/weather/\n[notes]: https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT205773\n[icd]: https://www.apple.com/icloud/\n[ss]: https://www.imore.com/siri-suggestions-whats-new-ios-12\n",

				"title": "Commiting to a Fitness Challenge and Then Figuring Out if it is Achievable",
				"content_html": "<p>My <a href=\"https://www.torqride.com/\">favourite spin studio</a> has put on a fitness challenge for 2019. It has many components, one of which is improving your performance by 3% over six weeks. I’ve taken on the challenge and am now worried that I don’t know how reasonable this increase actually is. So, a perfect excuse to extract my metrics and perform some excessive analysis.</p>\n<p>We start by importing a CSV file of my stats, taken from Torq’s website. We use <code>readr</code> for this and set the <code>col_types</code> in advance to specify the type for each column, as well as skip some extra columns with <code>col_skip</code>. I find doing this at the same time as the import, rather than later in the process, more direct and efficient. I also like the flexibility of the <code>col_date</code> import, where I can convert the source data (e.g., “Mon 11/02/19 - 6:10 AM”) into a format <a href=\"https://xkcd.com/1179/\">more useful for analysis</a> (e.g., “2019-02-11”).</p>\n<p>One last bit of clean up is to specify the instructors that have led 5 or more sessions. Later, we’ll try to identify an instructor-effect on my performance and only 5 of the 10 instructors have sufficient data for such an analysis. The <code>forcats::fct_other</code> function is really handy for this: it collapses several factor levels together into one “Other” level.</p>\n<p>Lastly, I set the <code>challenge_start_date</code> variable for use later on.</p>\n<pre class=\"r\"><code>col_types = cols(\n  Date = col_date(format = \"%a %d/%m/%y - %H:%M %p\"),\n  Ride = col_skip(),\n  Instructor = col_character(),\n  Spot = col_skip(),\n  `Avg RPM` = col_skip(),\n  `Max RPM` = col_skip(),\n  `Avg Power` = col_double(),\n  `Max Power` = col_double(),\n  `Total Energy` = col_double(),\n  `Dist.

Given relatively high variability from class to class, we add a smoothed line to show the overall trend. We also mark the point where the challenge starts with a red line.</p>\n<pre class=\"r\"><code>ggplot2::ggplot(data, aes(x = Date, y = avg_power)) +\n  ggplot2::geom_point() +\n  ggplot2::geom_line() +\n  geom_smooth(method = \"loess\") +\n  ggplot2::ylab(\"Average power\") +\n  ggplot2::geom_vline(xintercept = challenge_start_date, col = \"red\")</code></pre>\n<p><img src=\"uploads/2019/f229b3bab4.png\" width=\"672\" /></p>\n<p>Overall, looks like I made some steady progress when I started, plateaued in the Summer (when I didn’t ride as often), and then started a slow, steady increase in the Fall. Unfortunately for me, it also looks like I started to plateau in my improvement just in time for the challenge.</p>\n<p>We’ll start a more formal analysis by just testing to see what my average improvement is over time.</p>\n<pre class=\"r\"><code>time_model <- lm(avg_power ~ Date, data = data)\nsummary(time_model)</code></pre>\n<pre><code>## \n## Call:\n## lm(formula = avg_power ~ Date, data = data)\n## \n## Residuals:\n##     Min      1Q  Median      3Q     Max \n## -30.486 -11.356  -1.879  11.501  33.838 \n## \n## Coefficients:\n##               Estimate Std. Error t value Pr(>|t|)    \n## (Intercept) -2.032e+03  3.285e+02  -6.186 4.85e-08 ***\n## Date         1.264e-01  1.847e-02   6.844 3.49e-09 ***\n## ---\n## Signif. codes:  0 '***' 0.001 '**' 0.01 '*' 0.05 '.' 0.1 ' ' 1\n## \n## Residual standard error: 15.65 on 64 degrees of freedom\n## Multiple R-squared:  0.4226, Adjusted R-squared:  0.4136 \n## F-statistic: 46.85 on 1 and 64 DF,  p-value: 3.485e-09</code></pre>\n<p>Based on this, we can see that my performance is improving over time and the R<sup>2</sup> is decent. But, interpreting the coefficient for time isn’t entirely intuitive and isn’t really the point of the challenge. The question is: how much higher is my average power during the challenge than before? For that, we’ll set up a “dummy variable” based on the date of the class. Then we use <code>dplyr</code> to group by this variable and estimate the mean of the average power in both time periods.</p>\n<pre class=\"r\"><code>data %<>% \n  dplyr::mutate(in_challenge = ifelse(Date > challenge_start_date, 1, 0)) \n(change_in_power <- data %>% \n  dplyr::group_by(in_challenge) %>% \n  dplyr::summarize(mean_avg_power = mean(avg_power)))</code></pre>\n<pre><code>## # A tibble: 2 x 2\n##   in_challenge mean_avg_power\n##          <dbl>          <dbl>\n## 1            0           213.\n## 2            1           231.</code></pre>\n<p>So, I’ve improved from an average power of 213 to 231 for a improvement of 8%.

				"content_text": "<p>My <a href=\"https://www.torqride.com/\">favourite spin studio</a> has put on a fitness challenge for 2019. It has many components, one of which is improving your performance by 3% over six weeks. I’ve taken on the challenge and am now worried that I don’t know how reasonable this increase actually is. So, a perfect excuse to extract my metrics and perform some excessive analysis.</p>\n<p>We start by importing a CSV file of my stats, taken from Torq’s website. We use <code>readr</code> for this and set the <code>col_types</code> in advance to specify the type for each column, as well as skip some extra columns with <code>col_skip</code>. I find doing this at the same time as the import, rather than later in the process, more direct and efficient. I also like the flexibility of the <code>col_date</code> import, where I can convert the source data (e.g., “Mon 11/02/19 - 6:10 AM”) into a format <a href=\"https://xkcd.com/1179/\">more useful for analysis</a> (e.g., “2019-02-11”).</p>\n<p>One last bit of clean up is to specify the instructors that have led 5 or more sessions. Later, we’ll try to identify an instructor-effect on my performance and only 5 of the 10 instructors have sufficient data for such an analysis. The <code>forcats::fct_other</code> function is really handy for this: it collapses several factor levels together into one “Other” level.</p>\n<p>Lastly, I set the <code>challenge_start_date</code> variable for use later on.</p>\n<pre class=\"r\"><code>col_types = cols(\n  Date = col_date(format = \"%a %d/%m/%y - %H:%M %p\"),\n  Ride = col_skip(),\n  Instructor = col_character(),\n  Spot = col_skip(),\n  `Avg RPM` = col_skip(),\n  `Max RPM` = col_skip(),\n  `Avg Power` = col_double(),\n  `Max Power` = col_double(),\n  `Total Energy` = col_double(),\n  `Dist.

This suggests that controlling for instructor improves the time signal. However, when we add in time, none of the individual instructors are significantly different from each other. My interpretation of this is that my overall improvement over time is much more important than which particular instructor is leading the class. Nonetheless, the earlier analysis of the instructors gave me some insights that I can use to maximize the contribution each of them makes to my overall progress. When comparing these models with an ANOVA though, we find that there isn’t a significant difference between them.</p>\n<p>The last model to try is to look for a time by instructor interaction.</p>\n<pre class=\"r\"><code>time_instructor_interaction_model <- update(time_model, . ~ . * Instructor)\nsummary(time_instructor_interaction_model)</code></pre>\n<pre><code>## \n## Call:\n## lm(formula = avg_power ~ Date + Instructor + Date:Instructor, \n##     data = data)\n## \n## Residuals:\n##     Min      1Q  Median      3Q     Max \n## -31.328  -9.899   0.963  10.018  26.128 \n## \n## Coefficients:\n##                          Estimate Std.

Before getting too excited though, an ANOVA shows that this model isn’t any better than the simple model of just time. There’s always a risk with trying to explain main effects (like time) with interactions. The story here is really that we need more data to tease out the impacts of the instructor by time effect.</p>\n<p>The last point to make is that we’ve focused so far on the average power, since that’s the metric for this fitness challenge. There could be interesting interactions among average power, maximum power, RPMs, and total energy, each of which is available in these data. I’ll return to that analysis some other time.</p>\n<p>In the interests of science, I’ll keep going to these classes, just so we can figure out what impact instructors have on performance. In the meantime, looks like I’ll succeed with at least this component of the fitness challenge and I have the stats to prove it.</p>\n",

This was my first, serious use of the new <a href=\"https://r-spatial.github.io/sf/\"><code>sf</code> package</a> for geospatial analysis. I found the package much easier to use than some of my previous workflows for this sort of analysis, especially given its integration with the <a href=\"https://www.tidyverse.org/\">tidyverse</a>.</p>\n<p>We start by downloading the <a href=\"https://www.toronto.ca/city-government/data-research-maps/open-data/open-data-catalogue/#370e7072-0ba7-e477-121e-78ba5dac9649\">shapefile for voting locations</a> from the City of Toronto’s <a href=\"https://www.toronto.ca/city-government/data-research-maps/open-data/\">Open Data portal</a> and reading it with the <code>read_sf</code> function. Then, we pipe it to <code>st_transform</code> to set the appropriate <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Map_projection\">projection</a> for the data. In this case, this isn’t strictly necessary, since the shapefile is already in the right projection. But, I tend to do this for all shapefiles to avoid any oddities later.</p>\n<pre class=\"r\"><code>download.file(\"[opendata.toronto.ca/gcc/votin...](http://opendata.toronto.ca/gcc/voting_location_2018_wgs84.zip)\",\n                destfile = \"data-raw/voting_location_2018_wgs84.zip\", quiet = TRUE)\nunzip(\"data-raw/voting_location_2018_wgs84.zip\", exdir=\"data-raw/voting_location_2018_wgs84\")\ntoronto_locations <- sf::read_sf(\"data-raw/voting_location_2018_wgs84\", \n                                 layer = \"VOTING_LOCATION_2018_WGS84\") %>%\n  sf::st_transform(crs = \"+init=epsg:4326\")\ntoronto_locations</code></pre>\n<pre><code>## Simple feature collection with 1700 features and 13 fields\n## geometry type:  POINT\n## dimension:      XY\n## bbox:           xmin: -79.61937 ymin: 43.59062 xmax: -79.12531 ymax: 43.83052\n## epsg (SRID):    4326\n## proj4string:    +proj=longlat +datum=WGS84 +no_defs\n## # A tibble: 1,700 x 14\n##    POINT_ID FEAT_CD FEAT_C_DSC PT_SHRT_CD PT_LNG_CD POINT_NAME VOTER_CNT\n##       <dbl> <chr>   <chr>      <chr>      <chr>     <chr>          <int>\n##  1    10190 P       Primary    056        10056     <NA>              37\n##  2    10064 P       Primary    060        10060     <NA>             532\n##  3    10999 S       Secondary  058        10058     Malibu           661\n##  4    11342 P       Primary    052        10052     <NA>            1914\n##  5    10640 P       Primary    047        10047     The Summit       956\n##  6    10487 S       Secondary  061        04061     White Eag…        51\n##  7    11004 P       Primary    063        04063     Holy Fami…      1510\n##  8    11357 P       Primary    024        11024     Rosedale …      1697\n##  9    12044 P       Primary    018        05018     Weston Pu…      1695\n## 10    11402 S       Secondary  066        04066     Elm Grove…        93\n## # ... with 1,690 more rows, and 7 more variables: OBJECTID <dbl>,\n## #   ADD_FULL <chr>, X <dbl>, Y <dbl>, LONGITUDE <dbl>, LATITUDE <dbl>,\n## #   geometry <POINT [°]></code></pre>\n<p>The file has 1700 rows of data across 14 columns. The first 13 columns are data within the original shapefile. The last column is a <a href=\"https://www.rstudio.com/resources/videos/how-to-work-with-list-columns/\">list column</a> that is added by <code>sf</code> and contains the geometry of the location. This specific design feature is what makes an <code>sf</code> object work really well with the rest of the tidyverse: the geographical details are just a column in the data frame. This makes the data much easier to work with than in other approaches, where the data is contained within an <code>@data</code> slot of an object.</p>\n<p>Plotting the data is straightforward, since <code>sf</code> objects have a <code>plot</code> function. Here’s an example where we plot the number of voters (<code>VOTER_CNT</code>) at each location. If you squint just right, you can see the general outline of Toronto in these points.</p>\n<p><img src=\"uploads/2019/c1f3d1400b.png\" width=\"672\" /></p>\n<p>What we want to do next is use the voting location data to aggregate the votes cast at each location into census tracts. This then allows us to associate census characteristics (like age and income) with the pattern of votes and develop our statistical relationships for predicting voter behaviour.</p>\n<p>We’ll split this into several steps. The first is downloading and reading the census tract shapefile.</p>\n<pre class=\"r\"><code>download.file(\"[www12.statcan.gc.ca/census-re...](http://www12.statcan.gc.ca/census-recensement/2011/geo/bound-limit/files-fichiers/gct_000b11a_e.zip)\",\n                destfile = \"data-raw/gct_000b11a_e.zip\", quiet = TRUE)\nunzip(\"data-raw/gct_000b11a_e.zip\", exdir=\"data-raw/gct\")\ncensus_tracts <- sf::read_sf(\"data-raw/gct\", layer = \"gct_000b11a_e\") %>%\n  sf::st_transform(crs = \"+init=epsg:4326\")</code></pre>\n<p>Now that we have it, all we really want are the census tracts in Toronto (the shapefile includes census tracts across Canada). We achieve this by intersecting the Toronto voting locations with the census tracts using standard R subsetting notation.</p>\n<pre class=\"r\"><code>to_census_tracts <- census_tracts[toronto_locations,]</code></pre>\n<p>And, we can plot it to see how well the intersection worked. This time we’ll plot the CTUID, which is the unique identifier for each census tract. This doesn’t mean anything in this context, but adds some nice colour to the plot.</p>\n<pre class=\"r\"><code>plot(to_census_tracts[\"CTUID\"])</code></pre>\n<p><img src=\"uploads/2019/22d42cb3c3.png\" width=\"672\" /></p>\n<p>Now you can really see the shape of Toronto, as well as the size of each census tract.</p>\n<p>Next we need to manipulate the voting data to get votes received by major candidates in the 2018 election. We take these data from the <a href=\"https://github.com/Psepho/toVotes\"><code>toVotes</code> package</a> and arbitrarily set the threshold for major candidates to receiving at least 100,000 votes. This yields our two main candidates: John Tory and Jennifer Keesmaat.</p>\n<pre class=\"r\"><code>major_candidates <- toVotes %>% \n  dplyr::filter(year == 2018) %>%\n  dplyr::group_by(candidate) %>%\n  dplyr::summarise(votes = sum(votes)) %>%\n  dplyr::filter(votes > 100000) %>%\n  dplyr::select(candidate)\nmajor_candidates</code></pre>\n<pre><code>## # A tibble: 2 x 1\n##   candidate        \n##   <chr>            \n## 1 Keesmaat Jennifer\n## 2 Tory John</code></pre>\n<p>Given our goal of aggregating the votes received by each candidate into census tracts, we need a data frame that has each candidate in a separate column. We start by joining the major candidates table to the votes table. In this case, we also filter the votes to 2018, since John Tory has been a candidate in more than one election. Then we use the <code>tidyr</code> package to convert the table from long (with one candidate column) to wide (with a column for each candidate).</p>\n<pre class=\"r\"><code>spread_votes <- toVotes %>%\n  tibble::as.tibble() %>% \n  dplyr::filter(year == 2018) %>%\n  dplyr::right_join(major_candidates) %>%\n  dplyr::select(-type, -year) %>%\n  tidyr::spread(candidate, votes)\nspread_votes</code></pre>\n<pre><code>## # A tibble: 1,800 x 4\n##     ward  area `Keesmaat Jennifer` `Tory John`\n##    <int> <int>               <dbl>       <dbl>\n##  1     1     1                  66         301\n##  2     1     2                  72         376\n##  3     1     3                  40         255\n##  4     1     4                  24         161\n##  5     1     5                  51         211\n##  6     1     6                  74         372\n##  7     1     7                  70         378\n##  8     1     8                  10          77\n##  9     1     9                  11          82\n## 10     1    10                  12          76\n## # ... with 1,790 more rows</code></pre>\n<p>Our last step before finally aggregating to census tracts is to join the <code>spread_votes</code> table with the <code>toronto_locations</code> data.

This was my first, serious use of the new <a href=\"https://r-spatial.github.io/sf/\"><code>sf</code> package</a> for geospatial analysis.

Then, we pipe it to <code>st_transform</code> to set the appropriate <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Map_projection\">projection</a> for the data. In this case, this isn’t strictly necessary, since the shapefile is already in the right projection.

The first 13 columns are data within the original shapefile. The last column is a <a href=\"https://www.rstudio.com/resources/videos/how-to-work-with-list-columns/\">list column</a> that is added by <code>sf</code> and contains the geometry of the location. This specific design feature is what makes an <code>sf</code> object work really well with the rest of the tidyverse: the geographical details are just a column in the data frame. This makes the data much easier to work with than in other approaches, where the data is contained within an <code>@data</code> slot of an object.</p>\n<p>Plotting the data is straightforward, since <code>sf</code> objects have a <code>plot</code> function. Here’s an example where we plot the number of voters (<code>VOTER_CNT</code>) at each location. If you squint just right, you can see the general outline of Toronto in these points.</p>\n<p><img src=\"uploads/2019/c1f3d1400b.png\" width=\"672\" /></p>\n<p>What we want to do next is use the voting location data to aggregate the votes cast at each location into census tracts. This then allows us to associate census characteristics (like age and income) with the pattern of votes and develop our statistical relationships for predicting voter behaviour.</p>\n<p>We’ll split this into several steps. The first is downloading and reading the census tract shapefile.</p>\n<pre class=\"r\"><code>download.file(\"[www12.statcan.gc.ca/census-re...](http://www12.statcan.gc.ca/census-recensement/2011/geo/bound-limit/files-fichiers/gct_000b11a_e.zip)\",\n                destfile = \"data-raw/gct_000b11a_e.zip\", quiet = TRUE)\nunzip(\"data-raw/gct_000b11a_e.zip\", exdir=\"data-raw/gct\")\ncensus_tracts <- sf::read_sf(\"data-raw/gct\", layer = \"gct_000b11a_e\") %>%\n  sf::st_transform(crs = \"+init=epsg:4326\")</code></pre>\n<p>Now that we have it, all we really want are the census tracts in Toronto (the shapefile includes census tracts across Canada). We achieve this by intersecting the Toronto voting locations with the census tracts using standard R subsetting notation.</p>\n<pre class=\"r\"><code>to_census_tracts <- census_tracts[toronto_locations,]</code></pre>\n<p>And, we can plot it to see how well the intersection worked. This time we’ll plot the CTUID, which is the unique identifier for each census tract. This doesn’t mean anything in this context, but adds some nice colour to the plot.</p>\n<pre class=\"r\"><code>plot(to_census_tracts[\"CTUID\"])</code></pre>\n<p><img src=\"uploads/2019/22d42cb3c3.png\" width=\"672\" /></p>\n<p>Now you can really see the shape of Toronto, as well as the size of each census tract.</p>\n<p>Next we need to manipulate the voting data to get votes received by major candidates in the 2018 election. We take these data from the <a href=\"https://github.com/Psepho/toVotes\"><code>toVotes</code> package</a> and arbitrarily set the threshold for major candidates to receiving at least 100,000 votes. This yields our two main candidates: John Tory and Jennifer Keesmaat.</p>\n<pre class=\"r\"><code>major_candidates <- toVotes %>% \n  dplyr::filter(year == 2018) %>%\n  dplyr::group_by(candidate) %>%\n  dplyr::summarise(votes = sum(votes)) %>%\n  dplyr::filter(votes > 100000) %>%\n  dplyr::select(candidate)\nmajor_candidates</code></pre>\n<pre><code>## # A tibble: 2 x 1\n##   candidate        \n##   <chr>            \n## 1 Keesmaat Jennifer\n## 2 Tory John</code></pre>\n<p>Given our goal of aggregating the votes received by each candidate into census tracts, we need a data frame that has each candidate in a separate column. We start by joining the major candidates table to the votes table. In this case, we also filter the votes to 2018, since John Tory has been a candidate in more than one election. Then we use the <code>tidyr</code> package to convert the table from long (with one candidate column) to wide (with a column for each candidate).</p>\n<pre class=\"r\"><code>spread_votes <- toVotes %>%\n  tibble::as.tibble() %>% \n  dplyr::filter(year == 2018) %>%\n  dplyr::right_join(major_candidates) %>%\n  dplyr::select(-type, -year) %>%\n  tidyr::spread(candidate, votes)\nspread_votes</code></pre>\n<pre><code>## # A tibble: 1,800 x 4\n##     ward  area `Keesmaat Jennifer` `Tory John`\n##    <int> <int>               <dbl>       <dbl>\n##  1     1     1                  66         301\n##  2     1     2                  72         376\n##  3     1     3                  40         255\n##  4     1     4                  24         161\n##  5     1     5                  51         211\n##  6     1     6                  74         372\n##  7     1     7                  70         378\n##  8     1     8                  10          77\n##  9     1     9                  11          82\n## 10     1    10                  12          76\n## # ... with 1,790 more rows</code></pre>\n<p>Our last step before finally aggregating to census tracts is to join the <code>spread_votes</code> table with the <code>toronto_locations</code> data. This requires pulling the ward and area identifiers from the <code>PT_LNG_CD</code> column of the <code>toronto_locations</code> data frame which we do with some <code>stringr</code> functions. While we’re at it, we also update the candidate names to just surnames.</p>\n<pre class=\"r\"><code>to_geo_votes <- toronto_locations %>%\n  dplyr::mutate(ward = as.integer(stringr::str_sub(PT_LNG_CD, 1, 2)),\n                area = as.integer(stringr::str_sub(PT_LNG_CD, -3, -1))) %>%\n  dplyr::left_join(spread_votes) %>%\n  dplyr::select(`Keesmaat Jennifer`, `Tory John`) %>%\n  dplyr::rename(Keesmaat = `Keesmaat Jennifer`, Tory = `Tory John`)\nto_geo_votes</code></pre>\n<pre><code>## Simple feature collection with 1700 features and 2 fields\n## geometry type:  POINT\n## dimension:      XY\n## bbox:           xmin: -79.61937 ymin: 43.59062 xmax: -79.12531 ymax: 43.83052\n## epsg (SRID):    4326\n## proj4string:    +proj=longlat +datum=WGS84 +no_defs\n## # A tibble: 1,700 x 3\n##    Keesmaat  Tory             geometry\n##       <dbl> <dbl>          <POINT [°]>\n##  1       55   101 (-79.40225 43.63641)\n##  2       43    53  (-79.3985 43.63736)\n##  3       61    89 (-79.40028 43.63664)\n##  4      296   348 (-79.39922 43.63928)\n##  5      151   204 (-79.40401 43.64293)\n##  6        2    11 (-79.43941 43.63712)\n##  7      161   174 (-79.43511 43.63869)\n##  8      221   605  (-79.38188 43.6776)\n##  9       68   213 (-79.52078 43.70176)\n## 10        4    14 (-79.43094 43.64027)\n## # ... with 1,690 more rows</code></pre>\n<p>Okay, we’re finally there.

Then, since we’re only interested in the City of Toronto boundaries, we download the city’s shapefile too and intersect it with the provincial one to get a subset:</p>\n<pre class=\"r\"><code>download.file(\"[www.elections.on.ca/content/d...](https://www.elections.on.ca/content/dam/NGW/sitecontent/2016/preo/shapefiles/Polling%20Division%20Shapefile%20-%202014%20General%20Election.zip)\", \n              destfile = \"data-raw/Polling%20Division%20Shapefile%20-%202014%20General%20Election.zip\")\nunzip(\"data-raw/Polling%20Division%20Shapefile%20-%202014%20General%20Election.zip\", \n      exdir = \"data-raw/Polling%20Division%20Shapefile%20-%202014%20General%20Election\")\n\nprov_geo <- sf::st_read(\"data-raw/Polling%20Division%20Shapefile%20-%202014%20General%20Election\", \n                        layer = \"PDs_Ontario\") %>%\n  sf::st_transform(crs = \"+init=epsg:4326\")\n\ndownload.file(\"[opendata.toronto.ca/gcc/votin...](http://opendata.toronto.ca/gcc/voting_location_2014_wgs84.zip)\",\n              destfile = \"data-raw/voting_location_2014_wgs84.zip\")\nunzip(\"data-raw/voting_location_2014_wgs84.zip\", exdir=\"data-raw/voting_location_2014_wgs84\")\ntoronto_wards <- sf::st_read(\"data-raw/voting_location_2014_wgs84\", layer = \"VOTING_LOCATION_2014_WGS84\") %>%\n  sf::st_transform(crs = \"+init=epsg:4326\")\n\nto_prov_geo <- prov_geo %>%\n  sf::st_intersection(toronto_wards)</code></pre>\n<p>Now we just need to extract a couple of columns from the data frame associated with the shapefile. Then we process the values a bit so that they match the format of other data sets. This includes converting them to UTF-8, formatting as title case, and replacing dashes with spaces:</p>\n<pre class=\"r\"><code>electoral_districts <- to_prov_geo %>%\n  dplyr::transmute(electoral_district = as.character(DATA_COMPI),\n                   electoral_district_name = stringr::str_to_title(KPI04)) %>%\n  dplyr::group_by(electoral_district, electoral_district_name) %>%\n  dplyr::count() %>%\n  dplyr::ungroup() %>%\n  dplyr::mutate(electoral_district_name = stringr::str_replace_all(utf8::as_utf8(electoral_district_name), \"\\u0097\", \" \")) %>%\n  dplyr::select(electoral_district, electoral_district_name)\nelectoral_districts</code></pre>\n<pre><code>## Simple feature collection with 23 features and 2 fields\n## geometry type:  MULTIPOINT\n## dimension:      XY\n## bbox:           xmin: -79.61919 ymin: 43.59068 xmax: -79.12511 ymax: 43.83057\n## epsg (SRID):    4326\n## proj4string:    +proj=longlat +datum=WGS84 +no_defs\n## # A tibble: 23 x 3\n##    electoral_distri… electoral_distric…                           geometry\n##    <chr>             <chr>                                <MULTIPOINT [°]>\n##  1 005               Beaches East York  (-79.32736 43.69452, -79.32495 43…\n##  2 015               Davenport          (-79.4605 43.68283, -79.46003 43.…\n##  3 016               Don Valley East    (-79.35985 43.78844, -79.3595 43.…\n##  4 017               Don Valley West    (-79.40592 43.75026, -79.40524 43…\n##  5 020               Eglinton Lawrence  (-79.46787 43.70595, -79.46376 43…\n##  6 023               Etobicoke Centre   (-79.58697 43.6442, -79.58561 43.…\n##  7 024               Etobicoke Lakesho… (-79.56213 43.61001, -79.5594 43.…\n##  8 025               Etobicoke North    (-79.61919 43.72889, -79.61739 43…\n##  9 068               Parkdale High Park (-79.49944 43.66285, -79.4988 43.…\n## 10 072               Pickering Scarbor… (-79.18898 43.80374, -79.17927 43…\n## # ... with 13 more rows</code></pre>\n<p>In the end, this is a much more reliable solution, though it seems a bit extreme to use GIS techniques just to get a listing of Electoral District names and numbers.</p>\n<p>The commit with most of these changes in <a href=\"https://github.com/Psepho/toVotes\">toVotes</a> is <a href=\"https://github.com/Psepho/toVotes/commit/272ea413a6a9a11f0070bcc2c65ed2fcba6e5a4c\">here</a>.</p>\n",

				"content_html": "<p>In preparing for some <a href=\"http://www.psephoanalytics.ca/\">PsephoAnalytics</a> work on the upcoming provincial election, I’ve been wrangling the <a href=\"http://www.elections.on.ca/en/resource-centre/elections-results.html\">Elections Ontario</a> data. As provided, the data is really difficult to work with and we’ll walk through some steps to tidy these data for later analysis.</p>\n<p>Here’s what the source data looks like:</p>\n<div class=\"figure\">\n<img src=\"uploads/2019/90081f2261.png\" alt=\"Screenshot of raw Elections Ontario data\" />\n<p class=\"caption\">Screenshot of raw Elections Ontario data</p>\n</div>\n<p>A few problems with this:</p>\n<ol style=\"list-style-type: decimal\">\n<li>The data is scattered across a hundred different Excel files</li>\n<li>Candidates are in columns with their last name as the header</li>\n<li>Last names are not unique across all Electoral Districts, so can’t be used as a unique identifier</li>\n<li>Electoral District names are in a row, followed by a separate row for each poll within the district</li>\n<li>The party affiliation for each candidate isn’t included in the data</li>\n</ol>\n<p>So, we have a fair bit of work to do to get to something more useful. Ideally something like:</p>\n\n<pre><code>## # A tibble: 9 x 5\n##   electoral_district  poll candidate   party votes\n##                &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt;     &lt;chr&gt;   &lt;chr&gt; &lt;int&gt;\n## 1                  X     1         A Liberal    37\n## 2                  X     2         B     NDP    45\n## 3                  X     3         C      PC    33\n## 4                  Y     1         A Liberal    71\n## 5                  Y     2         B     NDP    37\n## 6                  Y     3         C      PC    69\n## 7                  Z     1         A Liberal    28\n## 8                  Z     2         B     NDP    15\n## 9                  Z     3         C      PC    34\n</code></pre>\n\n<p><p>This is much easier to work with: we have one row for the votes received by each candidate at each poll, along with the Electoral District name and their party affiliation.</p>\n<div id=\"candidate-parties\" class=\"section level2\">\n<h2>Candidate parties</h2>\n<p>As a first step, we need the party affiliation for each candidate. I didn’t see this information on the Elections Ontario site. So, we’ll pull the data from <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ontario_general_election,_2014#Candidates_by_region\">Wikipedia</a>. The data on this webpage isn’t too bad. We can just use the <code>table</code> xpath selector to pull out the tables and then drop the ones we aren’t interested in.</p>\n<pre class=\"r\"></p>\n\n<pre><code>candidate_webpage &lt;- &quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ontario_general_election,_2014#Candidates_by_region&quot;\ncandidate_tables &lt;- &quot;table&quot; # Use an xpath selector to get the drop down list by ID\n\ncandidates &lt;- xml2::read_html(candidate_webpage) %&gt;%\n  rvest::html_nodes(candidate_tables) %&gt;% # Pull tables from the wikipedia entry\n  .[13:25] %&gt;% # Drop unecessary tables\n  rvest::html_table(fill = TRUE)\n</code></pre>\n\n<p></pre>\n<p>This gives us a list of 13 data frames, one for each table on the webpage. Now we cycle through each of these and stack them into one data frame. Unfortunately, the tables aren’t consistent in the number of columns. So, the approach is a bit messy and we process each one in a loop.</p>\n<pre class=\"r\"><code># Setup empty dataframe to store results\ncandidate_parties &lt;- tibble::as_tibble(\n  electoral_district_name = NULL,\n  party = NULL,\n  candidate = NULL\n)</p>\n\n<p>for(i in seq_along(1:length(candidates))) { # Messy, but works\n  this_table &lt;- candidates[[i]]\n  # The header spans mess up the header row, so renaming\n  names(this_table) &lt;- c(this_table[1,-c(3,4)], &ldquo;NA&rdquo;, &ldquo;Incumbent&rdquo;)\n  # Get rid of the blank spacer columns\n  this_table &lt;- this_table[-1, ]\n  # Drop the NA columns by keeping only odd columns\n  this_table &lt;- this_table[,seq(from = 1, to = dim(this_table)[2], by = 2)]\n  this_table %&lt;&gt;%\n    tidyr::gather(party, candidate, -<code>Electoral District</code>) %&gt;%\n    dplyr::rename(electoral_district_name = <code>Electoral District</code>) %&gt;%\n    dplyr::filter(party != &ldquo;Incumbent&rdquo;)\n  candidate_parties &lt;- dplyr::bind_rows(candidate_parties, this_table)\n}\ncandidate_parties</code></pre>\n<pre></p>\n\n<pre><code>## # A tibble: 649 x 3\n##       electoral_district_name   party            candidate\n##                         &lt;chr&gt;   &lt;chr&gt;                &lt;chr&gt;\n##  1 Carleton—Mississippi Mills Liberal      Rosalyn Stevens\n##  2            Nepean—Carleton Liberal           Jack Uppal\n##  3              Ottawa Centre Liberal          Yasir Naqvi\n##  4             Ottawa—Orléans Liberal Marie-France Lalonde\n##  5               Ottawa South Liberal          John Fraser\n##  6              Ottawa—Vanier Liberal   Madeleine Meilleur\n##  7         Ottawa West—Nepean Liberal        Bob Chiarelli\n##  8 Carleton—Mississippi Mills      PC        Jack MacLaren\n##  9            Nepean—Carleton      PC         Lisa MacLeod\n## 10              Ottawa Centre      PC           Rob Dekker\n## # ... with 639 more rows\n</code></pre>\n\n<p></pre>\n</div>\n<div id=\"electoral-district-names\" class=\"section level2\">\n<h2>Electoral district names</h2>\n<p>One issue with pulling party affiliations from Wikipedia is that candidates are organized by Electoral District <em>names</em>. But the voting results are organized by Electoral District <em>number</em>. I couldn’t find an appropriate resource on the Elections Ontario site.

These are made available as a collection of Excel files in a compressed folder. To avoid downloading it more than once, we wrap the call in an <code>if</code> statement that first checks to see if we already have the file. We also rename the file to something more manageable.</p>\n<pre class=\"r\"><code>raw_results_file <- \"[www.elections.on.ca/content/d...](http://www.elections.on.ca/content/dam/NGW/sitecontent/2017/results/Poll%20by%20Poll%20Results%20-%20Excel.zip)\"\n\nzip_file <- \"data-raw/Poll%20by%20Poll%20Results%20-%20Excel.zip\"\nif(file.exists(zip_file)) { # Only download the data once\n  # File exists, so nothing to do\n}  else {\n  download.file(raw_results_file,\n                destfile = zip_file)\n  unzip(zip_file, exdir=\"data-raw\") # Extract the data into data-raw\n  file.rename(\"data-raw/GE Results - 2014 (unconverted)\", \"data-raw/pollresults\")\n}</code></pre>\n<pre><code>## NULL</code></pre>\n<p>Now we need to extract the votes out of 107 Excel files. The combination of <code>purrr</code> and <code>readxl</code> packages is great for this. In case we want to filter to just a few of the files (perhaps to target a range of Electoral Districts), we declare a <code>file_pattern</code>. For now, we just set it to any xls file that ends with three digits preceeded by a “_“.</p>\n<p>As we read in the Excel files, we clean up lots of blank columns and headers. Then we convert to a long table and drop total and blank rows. Also, rather than try to align the Electoral District name rows with their polls, we use the name of the Excel file to pull out the Electoral District number. Then we join with the <code>electoral_districts</code> table to pull in the Electoral District names.</p>\n<pre class=\"r\">\n```\nfile_pattern <- \"*_[[:digit:]]{3}.xls\" # Can use this to filter down to specific files\npoll_data <- list.files(path = \"data-raw/pollresults\", pattern = file_pattern, full.names = TRUE) %>% # Find all files that match the pattern\n  purrr::set_names() %>%\n  purrr::map_df(readxl::read_excel, sheet = 1, col_types = \"text\", .id = \"file\") %>%   # Import each file and merge into a dataframe\n  # Specifying sheet = 1 just to be clear we're ignoring the rest of the sheets\n  # Declare col_types since there are duplicate surnames and map_df can't recast column types in the rbind\n  # For example, Bell is in both district 014 and 063\n  dplyr::select(-starts_with(\"X__\")) %>% # Drop all of the blank columns\n  dplyr::select(1:2,4:8,15:dim(.)[2]) %>% # Reorganize a bit and drop unneeded columns\n  dplyr::rename(poll_number = `POLL NO.`) %>%\n  tidyr::gather(candidate, votes, -file, -poll_number) %>% # Convert to a long table\n  dplyr::filter(!is.na(votes),\n                poll_number != \"Totals\") %>%\n  dplyr::mutate(electoral_district = stringr::str_extract(file, \"[[:digit:]]{3}\"),\n                votes = as.numeric(votes)) %>%\n  dplyr::select(-file) %>%\n  dplyr::left_join(electoral_districts)\npoll_data\n```\n</pre>\n<pre>\n```\n## # A tibble: 143,455 x 5\n##    poll_number candidate votes electoral_district electoral_district_name\n##          <chr>     <chr> <dbl>              <chr>                   <chr>\n##  1         001   DICKSON    73                001          Ajax—Pickering\n##  2         002   DICKSON   144                001          Ajax—Pickering\n##  3         003   DICKSON    68                001          Ajax—Pickering\n##  4         006   DICKSON   120                001          Ajax—Pickering\n##  5         007   DICKSON    74                001          Ajax—Pickering\n##  6        008A   DICKSON    65                001          Ajax—Pickering\n##  7        008B   DICKSON    81                001          Ajax—Pickering\n##  8         009   DICKSON   112                001          Ajax—Pickering\n##  9         010   DICKSON   115                001          Ajax—Pickering\n## 10         011   DICKSON    74                001          Ajax—Pickering\n## # ... with 143,445 more rows\n```\n</pre>\n<p>The only thing left to do is to join <code>poll_data</code> with <code>candidate_parties</code> to add party affiliation to each candidate.

In other words, we aren’t considering anyone who donates nothing. We should really compare these median donations to the total population or the size of the economy.

But, I’m always happy to look more closely at data and provide some context for public debates.</p>\n<p>One major gap with this type of analysis is that we’re only looking at the median donations of people that donated anything at all. In other words, we aren’t considering anyone who donates nothing. We should really compare these median donations to the total population or the size of the economy. This <a href=\"http://www.statcan.gc.ca/pub/11-008-x/2012001/article/11637-eng.htm\">Stats Can</a> study is a much more thorough look at the issue.</p>\n<p>For me the interesting result here is the dramatic difference between Quebec and the rest of the provinces. But, I don’t interpret this to mean that Quebecers are less generous than the rest of Canada. Seems more likely that there are material differences in how the Quebec economy and social safety nets are structured.</p>\n",

				"content_html": "<p>I recently participated in a panel discussion at the <a href=\"http://www.careers.utoronto.ca/\">University of Toronto</a> on the career transition from academic research to public service. I really enjoyed the discussion and there were many great questions from the audience. Here’s just a brief summary of some of the main points I tried to make about the differences between academics and public service.</p>\n\n<p>The major difference I’ve experienced involves a trade-off between control and influence.</p>\n\n<p>As a grad student and post-doctoral researcher I had almost complete control over my work. I could decide what was interesting, how to pursue questions, who to talk to, and when to work on specific components of my research. I believe that I made some <a href=\"http://files.me.com/mroutley/o38cwy\">important</a> <a href=\"http://files.me.com/mroutley/xura8h\">contributions</a> to my field of study. But, to be honest, this work had very little influence beyond a small group of colleagues who are also interested in the evolution of floral form.</p>\n\n<p>Now I want to be clear about this: in no way should this be interpreted to mean that scientific research is not important. This is how scientific progress is made – many scientists working on particular, specific questions that are aggregated into general knowledge. This work is important and deserves support. Plus, it was incredibly interesting and rewarding.</p>\n\n<p>However, the comparison of the influence of my academic research with my work on infrastructure policy is revealing. Roads, bridges, transit, hospitals, schools, courthouses, and jails all have <a href=\"http://www.mei.gov.on.ca/en/infrastructure/\">significant impacts</a> on the day-to-day experience of millions of people. Every day I am involved in decisions that determine where, when, and how the government will invest scarce resources into these important services.</p>\n\n<p>Of course, this is where the control-influence trade-off kicks in. As an individual public servant, I have very little control over these decisions or how my work will be used. Almost everything I do involves medium-sized teams with members from many departments and ministries. This requires extensive collaboration, often under very tight time constraints with high profile outcomes.</p>\n\n<p>For example, in my first week as a <a href=\"http://www.mei.gov.on.ca/\">public servant</a> I started a year-long process to integrate and enhance decision-making processes across 20 ministries and 2 agencies. The project team included engineers, policy analysts, accountants, lawyers, economists, and external consultants from all of the major government sectors. The (rather long) document produced by this process is now used to inform every infrastructure decision made by the province.</p>\n\n<p>Governments contend with really interesting and complicated problems that no one else can or will consider. Businesses generally take on the easy and profitable issues, while NGOs are able to focus on specific aspects of issues. Consequently, working on government policy provides a seemingly endless supply of challenges and puzzles to solve, or at least mitigate. I find this very rewarding.</p>\n\n<p>None of this is to suggest that either option is better than the other. I’ve been lucky to have had two very interesting careers so far, which have been at the opposite ends of this control-influence trade-off. Nonetheless, my experience suggests that an actual academic career is incredibly challenging to obtain and may require significant compromises. Public service can offer many of the same intellectual challenges with better job prospects and work-life balance. But, you need to be comfortable with the diminished control.</p>\n\n<p>Thanks to my colleague <a href=\"http://ca.linkedin.com/pub/andrew-miller/14/83a/148\">Andrew Miller</a> for creating the panel and inviting me to participate.

Citizens become confused and disinterested,\ncustomers become jaded, and people loose their love for language.\nAlso, as a public servant I see this kind of language every day and\noften find myself struggling to avoid banality and cliches (not to\nmention bullet points).  We need more forceful advocates like Don\nWatson to call out politicians and corporations for abusing our\nlanguage.  This book certainly makes me want to try harder.

Citizens become confused and disinterested,\ncustomers become jaded, and people loose their love for language.\nAlso, as a public servant I see this kind of language every day and\noften find myself struggling to avoid banality and cliches (not to\nmention bullet points).  We need more forceful advocates like Don\nWatson to call out politicians and corporations for abusing our\nlanguage.  This book certainly makes me want to try harder.  And\nwhat’s more inspiring than struggling for a good cause against long\nodds?</p>\n\n<p>The book also has a great glossary of typical weasel words with possible synonyms.

Particular stand out tracks are <a href=\"http://phobos.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewAlbum?i=187018157&amp;id=187017583&amp;s=143455\">Luscious Life</a>, <a href=\"http://phobos.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewAlbum?i=187018250&amp;id=187017583&amp;s=143455\">Drifters</a>, and <a href=\"http://phobos.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewAlbum?i=187018471&amp;id=187017583&amp;s=143455\">The Great Escape</a>.

Since my main source of national news and analysis is the <a href=\"http://www.theglobeandmail.com/\">Globe and Mail</a>, I’m quite happy that they provide <a href=\"http://www.theglobeandmail.com/rss/\">many feeds</a> for accessing their content. The problem is that many news stories are duplicated across these feeds. Furthermore, tracking all of the feeds of interest is challenging.</p>\n\n<p>The new <a href=\"http://pipes.yahoo.com/\">Yahoo Pipes</a> offer a solution to these problems. Without providing too much detail, pipes are a way to filter, connect, and generally mash-up the web with a straightforward interface. I’ve used this service to collect all of the Globe and Mail feeds of interest, filter out the duplicates, and produce a feed I can subscribe to.

Nonetheless, a great deal of my mental energy is devoted to trying to remember such details and fearing the consequences of the inevitable “it slipped my mind”. As counselled by <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GTD\">GTD</a>, I need a good and trustworthy system for removing these important, but distracting, details and having them reappear when needed. I’ve finally settled in on the new product from <a href=\"http://www.valuesofn.com/\">values of n</a> called <a href=\"http://stikkit.com/\">Stikkit</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Stikkit appeals to me for two main reasons: easy data entry and smart text processing. Stikkit uses the metaphor of the yellow sticky note for capturing text. When you create a new note, you are presented with a simple text field — nothing more. However, Stikkit parses your note for some key words and extracts information to make the note more useful. For example, if you type:</p>\n\n<pre><code>Phone call with John Smith on Feb 1 at 1pm\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Stikkit realises that you are describing an event scheduled for February 1st at one in the afternoon with a person (“peep” in Stikkit slang) named John Smith. A separate note will be created to track information about John Smith and will be linked to the phone call note. If you add the text “remind me” to the note, Stikkit will send you an email and SMS message prior to the event. You can also include tags to group notes together with the keywords “tag as”.</p>\n\n<p>A recent update to peeps makes them even more useful. Stikkit now collects information about people as you create notes. So, for example, if I later post:</p>\n\n<pre><code>- Send documents to John Smith john@smith.net\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Stikkit will recognise John Smith and update my peep for him with the email address provided. In this way, Stikkit becomes more useful as you continue to add information to notes. Also, the prefixed “-” causes Stikkit to recognise this note as a todo. I can then list all of my todos and check them off as they are completed.</p>\n\n<p>This text processing greatly simplifies data entry, since I don’t need to click around to create todos are choose dates from a calendar picker. Just type in the text, hit save, and I’m done. Fortunately, Stikkit has been designed to be smart rather than clever. The distinction here is that Stikkit relies on some key words (such as at, for, to) to mark up notes consistently and reliably. Clever software is exemplified by Microsoft Word’s autocorrect or clipboard assistant. My first goal when encountering these “features” is to turn them off. I find they rarely do the right thing and end up being a hindrance. <a href=\"http://stikkit.com/\">Stikkit</a> is well worth a look.

These files are kept in the data folder and converted to sql databases for analyses.</p>\n\n<p><em>doc</em> holds the analysis and writeup as a <a href=\"http://www.ci.tuwien.ac.at/~leisch/Sweave/FAQ.html\">Sweave</a> file. This combines R and <a href=\"http://www.latex-project.org/\">LaTeX</a> to create a complete document from one source file.</p>\n\n<p><em>fig</em> is for diagrams and plots. Many of these are generated when processing the Sweave file, but some are constructed from other sources.</p>\n\n<p><em>utils</em> holds scripts and binaries that are required to run the analysis.</p>\n\n<p>This entire directory structure is maintained with <a href=\"http://subversion.tigris.org/\">Subversion</a>, so I have a record of changes and can access the project files from any networked computer.</p>\n\n<p>Finally, once a project is complete, I archive the project and construct a sha <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Checksum\">checksum</a> of the zip file.</p>\n\n<p><code>openssl dgst -sha1 -out checksums.txt archive.zip</code></p>\n\n<p>This checksum allows me to verify that the archive remains stable over time. Coupled with a good backup routine, this should keep the project files safe.</p>\n\n<p>This may seem elaborate, but data and their analyses are too important to be left scattered around a laptop’s hard drive.</p>\n\n<p>One other approach I’ve considered is using the R package structure to maintain projects. <a href=\"http://www.maths.bris.ac.uk/~maman/computerstuff/Rhelp/Rpackages.html\">This</a> is a useful guide, but the process seems too involved for my purposes.</p>\n",

				"title": "The effect of protandry on siring success in Chamerion angustifolium (Onagraceae) with different inflorescence sizes",
				"content_html": "<p>Protandry, a form of temporal separation of gender within hermaphroditic flowers, may reduce the magnitude of pollen lost to selfing (pollen discounting) and also serve to enhance pollen export and outcross siring success. Because pollen discounting is strongest when selfing occurs between flowers on the same plant, the advantage of protandry may be greatest in plants with large floral displays. We tested this hypothesis with enclosed, artificial populations of Chamerion angustifolium (Onagraceae) by experimentally manipulating protandry (producing uniformly adichogamous or mixed protandrous and adichogamous populations) and inflorescence size (two-, six-, or 10-flowered inflorescences) and measuring pollinator visitation, seed set, female outcrossing rate, and outcross siring success. Bees spent more time foraging on and visited more flowers of larger inflorescences than small. Female outcrossing rates did not vary among inflorescence size treatments.

				"content_text": "<p>Protandry, a form of temporal separation of gender within hermaphroditic flowers, may reduce the magnitude of pollen lost to selfing (pollen discounting) and also serve to enhance pollen export and outcross siring success. Because pollen discounting is strongest when selfing occurs between flowers on the same plant, the advantage of protandry may be greatest in plants with large floral displays. We tested this hypothesis with enclosed, artificial populations of Chamerion angustifolium (Onagraceae) by experimentally manipulating protandry (producing uniformly adichogamous or mixed protandrous and adichogamous populations) and inflorescence size (two-, six-, or 10-flowered inflorescences) and measuring pollinator visitation, seed set, female outcrossing rate, and outcross siring success. Bees spent more time foraging on and visited more flowers of larger inflorescences than small. Female outcrossing rates did not vary among inflorescence size treatments. However, seed set per fruit decreased with increasing inflorescence size, likely as a result of increased abortion of selfed embryos, perhaps obscuring the magnitude of geitonogamous selfing.

The combination of mailing lists, alerts, table of content notifications, and actual email from friends and colleagues was reaching a few hundred emails a day. The insanity had to stop! Here’s how I regained control.</p>\n\n<h2>Goals</h2>\n\n<p>Before describing my solution, let’s consider what a good email system should provide?</p>\n\n<p><ul><li>Notifications of relevant new messages.</li>\n<li>A process for keeping track of important and unanswered messages.</li>\n<li>Automatic archiving with excellent search capabilities.</li>\n<li>Portability and easy access.</li>\n</ul><h2>Strategy</h2></p>\n\n<p>I implemented my strategy as I switched to a <a href=\"http://mail.google.com\">Gmail</a> account, which required that I catalogue and cancel all of my email subscriptions. Rather than re-subscribing to these, I redirected as many as possible to <a href=\"http://ranchero.com/netnewswire\">NetNewsWire</a>. Many journals now provide feeds for their table of content alerts (e.g., <a href=\"http://www.nature.com/nature/newsfeeds.html\">Nature</a>) and most of the important newsgroups are available through <a href=\"http://www.gmane.com/\">Gmane</a>. The advantage of news feeds over email alerts is that I can easily group the alerts and choose when to refresh the subscriptions. Typically, I refresh my feed subscriptions in the morning as I caffeinate. I can simply flag important threads or articles for followup later if necessary and my Inbox is no longer cluttered.</p>\n\n<p>Switching to Gmail also immediately solved several other issues with email. First, I no longer worry about storing and archiving email. All of it stays on Google’s servers. Second, this also solves the problem of deciding which messages to keep. Previously, for every new message I had to decide whether to delete it forever or store a copy. Although this only takes a few seconds for each message, when you receive hundreds of messages this can add up. Now, I don’t worry about it. I know that with the combination of Gmail’s search capabilities and my Mac’s <a href=\"http://www.apple.com/macosx/features/spotlight/\">Spotlight</a> technology, I can find messages almost instantly. Third, Gmail is available from any webbrowser – now, so is my email.</p>\n\n<p>That’s great so far, but I still have a variety of unfiltered email and I want to only be alerted to important or relevant messages. This is where <a href=\"http://www.apple.com/macosx/features/mail/\">Mail.app’s</a> smart mailboxes and rules become important. The most important rule is that a message from someone who is not in my <a href=\"http://www.apple.com/macosx/features/addressbook/\">Address Book</a> is immediately redirected out of my Inbox. I’ve also implemented a variety of <a href=\"http://mail.google.com/support/bin/answer.py?answer=12096&topic=1565\">aliases</a> that allows easy filtering of email from my Inbox. All of these filtered messages are gathered together in a folder which I, generally, peruse once a day.</p>\n\n<p>Now I’m left with an Inbox containing only messages from people that I know. As new mail arrives, any mail that survives my filters is sent to <a href=\"http://growl.info/\">Growl</a> and an unobtrusive notification apprises me of the sender and subject. I can then choose to ignore the message if I’m busy or switch to Mail and read the message if it appears to be important.</p>\n\n<p>As I process my messages, I implement the <a href=\"http://www.amazon.ca/exec/obidos/redirect?link_code=ur2&tag=matthewroutle-20&camp=15121&creative=330641&path=ASIN%2F0142000280%2Fqid%3D1133552449%2Fsr%3D8-1%2Fref%3Dsr_8_xs_ap_i1_xgl\">GTD</a> workflow: if responding takes less than two minutes, I respond; otherwise, the message is flagged for follow-up. Finally, I have two smart mailboxes: flagged messages; and messages received today. Since I’ve asked Mail to group messages by thread, today’s messages also pull in all of my previous correspondence on the subject. Messages in these two mailboxes are what appear in my main message window. When I switch to Mail all I see are flagged, and therefore important, messages and current conversations.</p>\n\n<p>This all may seem elaborate, but I find it works well.</p>\n",

Here’s how I regained control.</p>\n\n<h2>Goals</h2>\n\n<p>Before describing my solution, let’s consider what a good email system should provide?</p>\n\n<ul><li>Notifications of relevant new messages.</li>\n<li>A process for keeping track of important and unanswered messages.</li>\n<li>Automatic archiving with excellent search capabilities.</li>\n<li>Portability and easy access.</li>\n</ul><h2>Strategy</h2>\n\n<p>I implemented my strategy as I switched to a <a href=\"http://mail.google.com\">Gmail</a> account, which required that I catalogue and cancel all of my email subscriptions. Rather than re-subscribing to these, I redirected as many as possible to <a href=\"http://ranchero.com/netnewswire\">NetNewsWire</a>. Many journals now provide feeds for their table of content alerts (e.g., <a href=\"http://www.nature.com/nature/newsfeeds.html\">Nature</a>) and most of the important newsgroups are available through <a href=\"http://www.gmane.com/\">Gmane</a>. The advantage of news feeds over email alerts is that I can easily group the alerts and choose when to refresh the subscriptions. Typically, I refresh my feed subscriptions in the morning as I caffeinate. I can simply flag important threads or articles for followup later if necessary and my Inbox is no longer cluttered.</p>\n\n<p>Switching to Gmail also immediately solved several other issues with email. First, I no longer worry about storing and archiving email. All of it stays on Google’s servers. Second, this also solves the problem of deciding which messages to keep. Previously, for every new message I had to decide whether to delete it forever or store a copy. Although this only takes a few seconds for each message, when you receive hundreds of messages this can add up. Now, I don’t worry about it. I know that with the combination of Gmail’s search capabilities and my Mac’s <a href=\"http://www.apple.com/macosx/features/spotlight/\">Spotlight</a> technology, I can find messages almost instantly. Third, Gmail is available from any webbrowser – now, so is my email.</p>\n\n<p>That’s great so far, but I still have a variety of unfiltered email and I want to only be alerted to important or relevant messages. This is where <a href=\"http://www.apple.com/macosx/features/mail/\">Mail.app’s</a> smart mailboxes and rules become important. The most important rule is that a message from someone who is not in my <a href=\"http://www.apple.com/macosx/features/addressbook/\">Address Book</a> is immediately redirected out of my Inbox. I’ve also implemented a variety of <a href=\"http://mail.google.com/support/bin/answer.py?answer=12096&topic=1565\">aliases</a> that allows easy filtering of email from my Inbox. All of these filtered messages are gathered together in a folder which I, generally, peruse once a day.</p>\n\n<p>Now I’m left with an Inbox containing only messages from people that I know. As new mail arrives, any mail that survives my filters is sent to <a href=\"http://growl.info/\">Growl</a> and an unobtrusive notification apprises me of the sender and subject. I can then choose to ignore the message if I’m busy or switch to Mail and read the message if it appears to be important.</p>\n\n<p>As I process my messages, I implement the <a href=\"http://www.amazon.ca/exec/obidos/redirect?link_code=ur2&tag=matthewroutle-20&camp=15121&creative=330641&path=ASIN%2F0142000280%2Fqid%3D1133552449%2Fsr%3D8-1%2Fref%3Dsr_8_xs_ap_i1_xgl\">GTD</a> workflow: if responding takes less than two minutes, I respond; otherwise, the message is flagged for follow-up. Finally, I have two smart mailboxes: flagged messages; and messages received today. Since I’ve asked Mail to group messages by thread, today’s messages also pull in all of my previous correspondence on the subject. Messages in these two mailboxes are what appear in my main message window. When I switch to Mail all I see are flagged, and therefore important, messages and current conversations.</p>\n\n<p>This all may seem elaborate, but I find it works well.</p>\n",

The results suggest that paternal function may be more sensitive to the effects of clonality than female function.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"uploads/2019/e56ae8b5b6.jpg\" width=\"360\" height=\"360\" alt=\"appleCloneSize\"/></p>\n\n<h2>Collaborator(s):</h2>\n\n<ul><li><a href=\"http://www.uoguelph.ca/botany/research/evollab/\">Brian Husband</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.uoguelph.ca/botany/research/evollab/whoweare.htm#PaulKron\">Paul Kron</a></li>\n</ul><h2>Publication(s):</h2>\n\n<ul><li>Routley M.B., Kron P. & Husband B.C., 2004, The consequences of clone size for paternal and maternal success in domestic apple (<em>Malus x domestica</em>).

				"content_html": "<p>Dichogamy, the temporal separation of gender within a flower, is widespread throughout the angiosperms, occurring in over 250 families. There are two forms of dichogamy: protandry, in which male function precedes female function, and protogyny, the converse. Dichogamy has traditionally been interpreted as a mechanism to avoid inbreeding. However, recent evidence indicates that this inbreeding-avoidance hypothesis cannot completely explain the evolution of dichogamy. An alternate hypothesis is that dichogamy acts to reduce interference between gender functions. Interference can occur within a flower or between flowers on an inflorescence and result in substantial reductions in male and female reproductive success. To date there are very few tests of this interference-avoidance hypothesis or, in fact, investigations of the evolution of dichogamy in general. My Ph.D. thesis was a comprehensive evaluation of the evolutionary significance of dichogamy, including functional, genetic, comparative, and theoretical analyses of this important floral character.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"uploads/2019/02908cc8b7.jpg\" width=\"250\" height=\"331\" alt=\"clint\"/></p>\n\n<p>This Claytonia species is protandrous. The flower on the left is in male phase with its anthers shedding pollen and the stigma closed and unreceptive. The flower on the right is approximately one day older and is in female phase. The stigma is open and receptive and the anthers have moved away to the side and are empty of pollen.</p>\n\n<h2>Functional analyses</h2>\n\n<p>As an evaluation of the fitness consequences of protandry, we tested the interference-avoidance hypothesis with enclosed, artificial populations of Chamerion angustifolium (Onagraceae) by experimentally manipulating protandry and inflorescence size and measuring pollinator visitation, seed set, female outcrossing-rate, and outcross siring-success. Protandrous plants had a marginally higher female outcrossing rate than adichogamous plants, but similar seed set and visitation rates. More importantly, protandrous plants (blue points) had, on average, a twofold siring advantage relative to adichogamous plants (red points). However, this siring advantage did not increase linearly with inflorescence size, suggesting that protandry acts to enhance siring success, but not exclusively by reducing between-flower interference.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"uploads/2019/885b748f18.jpg\" width=\"500\" height=\"458\" alt=\"siring\"/></p>\n\n<p>To better understand the function of protandry, we analyzed single bee visits to pairs of C. angustifolium flowers in the field and the lab. The patterns of pollen removal and deposition revealed two major consequences of simultaneous hermaphroditism. First, the presence of anthers impeded pollinator’s access to the stigma. Second, pollinators spent more time foraging on hermaphroditic flowers, relative to female flowers. Protandry allows pollen to be exported in the absence of this within-flower interference and can enhance both male and female reproductive success through reductions in pollen discounting and facilitated selfing, respectively.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"uploads/2019/eb7545a393.jpg\" width=\"400\" height=\"299\" alt=\"beevisit\"/></p>\n\n<h2>Genetic analysis</h2>\n\n<p>The genetic basis of dichogamy may have important implications for its evolution. Consequently, we conducted genetic analyses of protandry in C. angustifolium using a paternal half-sib design and an artificial selection experiment. We found moderate heritability (h^2^=0.27) for the duration of male phase. An analysis of plants from the artificial selection experiment showed no genetic correlation between male-phase duration and aspects of floral size. However, we estimated a positive genetic correlation between male-phase duration and floral display size. In addition, we detected a negative correlation between male- and female-phase durations which creates the opportunity for fitness trade-offs between male and female function.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"uploads/2019/65f28c4282.jpg\" width=\"464\" height=\"442\" alt=\"sel\"/></p>\n\n<h2>Phylogenetic analysis</h2>\n\n<p>To gain a broader perspective on the evolution of dichogamy, we used a current, well resolved phylogeny of the angiosperms to conduct a comparative analysis of dichogamy and self-incompatibility. Using paired-comparisons and maximum-likelihood correlation analyses, we found that protandry is positively correlated with self-incompatibility and protogyny with self-compatibility. These results support a role for interference avoidance in the evolution of protandry and inbreeding avoidance in the evolution of protogyny, suggesting that the two forms of dichogamy provide different functions. In addition, dichogamy changes character states throughout the phylogeny, allowing rapid responses to changing ecological circumstance.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"uploads/2019/3de9902b7b.jpg\" width=\"500\" height=\"375\" alt=\"phylo\"/></p>\n\n<h2>Theoretical analysis</h2>\n\n<p>We developed a conceptual model to synthesize the effects of male-phase duration, inflorescence size, and inbreeding depression on pollen import and export.

Furthermore, the trade-off between male- and female-phase durations produced a fitness landscape much more favourable to the evolution of protandry.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"uploads/2019/1eafaacb9c.jpg\" width=\"451\" height=\"366\" alt=\"relfitness\"/></p>\n\n<h2>Conclusions</h2>\n\n<p>Collectively, this research suggest that protandry enhances male fitness through reductions in both within- and between-flower interference, while protogyny reduces inbreeding.

One effect of this unequal distribution of pollinator activity is that pollinators create networks of connections between plants in which a few plant receive many visits and many plants receive few visits. Such networks are termed ‘scale-free’ and can be contrasted with random networks. Random networks follow a Poisson distribution of connection frequency and have the familiar bell shape characteristic of many biological patterns. Scale-free networks have power-law distributions with no peak, just a steady decline in the frequency of nodes with increasing number of connections.

Clearly plant populations experience changes in population size and pollinator behaviour often leads to 'traplining’ or enhanced visitation to particular phenotypes.

Scale-free networks are very resilient to the random loss of nodes, because the vast majority of network function is provided by the hubs.

				"content_html": "<p>In some recent research (<a href=\"http://public.me.com/mroutley/SIandDichogamy.pdf\">http://public.me.com/mroutley/SIandDichogamy.pdf</a>) I had to make inferences about families based on character states of the species within the family. One approach is to use a simple majority rule. For example, if more than half of the species possess character state x rather than y, then the family can be described as x. However, this approach seemed rather liberal, which led to a 2/3 majority criterion: if more than 2/3 of the species are x, the family is x; If less than 1/3 is x the family is y; otherwise the family is ambiguous.</p>\n\n<p>A significant drawback to arbitrarily creating such criteria is that I had no idea what the consequences were for making Type I and Type II errors. Presumably, as the criterion becomes more stringent, Type I errors are less likely, but such uncertainty is not comforting. I decided a better approach would be to attempt a simulation study using different criteria coupled with a more sophisticated character state reconstruction algorithm.</p>\n\n<p>The general approach was to create a family of twenty species and randomly assign a fixed proportion of each species one of two possible character states. The fixed probability chosen represented the decision criteria to be evaluated. For example, a 51% proportion is equivalent to the simple majority criterion. I then randomly generated 5,000 phylogenetic tree topologies for the family.

The idea is that the maximum-likelihood reconstruction should be reasonably accurate, since it incorporates tree topology into its calculations. If the decision criterion and maximum-likelihood approaches yield similar answers, the decision criterion may be a good choice for describing families in the absence of species-level phylogenetic resolution.</p>\n\n<p>I tested three decision criteria. Their results are: an 80% criterion was 98.1% accurate, 65% was 91.6%, and 55% was 60.8%. Clearly more stringent criteria are most similar to the more sophisticated maximum-likelihood analyses. However, stringency does exclude more data from the analysis as more families become ambiguously coded. A proper trade-off between stringency and sample size is required to make the best use of data.</p>\n\n<p>I conducted these simulations with <a href=\"http://www.mesquiteproject.org\">Mesquite</a> and the data file is available(<a href=\"http://public.me.com/mroutley/simulations.nex\">http://public.me.com/mroutley/simulations.nex</a>).</p>\n",
				"content_text": "<p>In some recent research (<a href=\"http://public.me.com/mroutley/SIandDichogamy.pdf\">http://public.me.com/mroutley/SIandDichogamy.pdf</a>) I had to make inferences about families based on character states of the species within the family. One approach is to use a simple majority rule. For example, if more than half of the species possess character state x rather than y, then the family can be described as x. However, this approach seemed rather liberal, which led to a 2/3 majority criterion: if more than 2/3 of the species are x, the family is x; If less than 1/3 is x the family is y; otherwise the family is ambiguous.</p>\n\n<p>A significant drawback to arbitrarily creating such criteria is that I had no idea what the consequences were for making Type I and Type II errors. Presumably, as the criterion becomes more stringent, Type I errors are less likely, but such uncertainty is not comforting. I decided a better approach would be to attempt a simulation study using different criteria coupled with a more sophisticated character state reconstruction algorithm.</p>\n\n<p>The general approach was to create a family of twenty species and randomly assign a fixed proportion of each species one of two possible character states. The fixed probability chosen represented the decision criteria to be evaluated. For example, a 51% proportion is equivalent to the simple majority criterion. I then randomly generated 5,000 phylogenetic tree topologies for the family. To evaluate any given decision criterion, I compared the family characterization from the decision criterion to the ancestral-state reconstruction from <a href=\"http://links.jstor.org/sici?sici=0014-3820%28199712%2951%3A6%3C1699%3ALOASIA%3E2.0.CO%3B2-4\">Schluter et al’s</a> maximum-likelihood analysis.
