I really cut back on my various internet feeds, so that I was less distracted away from books. [Purchasing a Kobo](https://matt.routleynet.org/2022/07/24/my-annual-cottage.html) and connecting it to the local public library was also helpful. \n\nThe most influential non-fiction book for me this year was [Four Thousand Weeks](https://micro.blog/books/9780374159122) by Oliver Burkeman. Plenty of practical and insightful advice in this book. \n\nPicking a favourite fiction book is always fraught. This year, I think it was [A Closed and Common Orbit](https://micro.blog/books/9781473621459) by Becky Chambers. Something about the emotional core of this book really resonated with me. \n\nHere’s the full list of books from the year:\n\n{{< bookgoals 2022 >}}\n",

				"content_html": "<p>After a few days of recovery, and before I forget, here are a few notes on the <a href=\"https://matt.routleynet.org/2022/06/27/the-ironman-in.html\">Tremblant 70.3 Ironman</a>.</p>\n<p>The short version (given there&rsquo;s lots of details below) is that the course was fantastic and the race was really well organized.</p>\n<h2 id=\"pre-race\">Pre-race</h2>\n<p>This part was easy and the day prior to the race. There were scheduled times for registration and all we needed was the QR code from our online payment. With that, they handed over a wristband, timing chip, all sorts of stickers with my bib number, swim cap, t-shirt, and a morning gear bag for transferring clothing from the swim start to the run finish.</p>\n<p>Next up was dropping my bike off at the transition. There were two stickers for the bike, both of which had my bib number on them and matched the number on my wristband. Staff at the transition entrance used these to make sure the bike belonged to me, before letting me in. Then I tracked down my transition spot, which was at the bike start end of the transition zone.</p>\n<p>They also had a mandatory athlete&rsquo;s briefing in the afternoon. As a first timer, this was really helpful. They talked through the overall course, showed some specific turn arounds and tricky spots, and then reminded us of the important rules. There were also repeated (and welcome) warnings that race day was going to be exceedingly hot (at least for recently hibernating Canadians) and that everyone needed to take precautions.</p>\n<p>That was it for the Saturday events, other than finding some food and trying to get a good night&rsquo;s sleep. Sunday (race day) started early, so that I could get the rest of my transition spot set up by 6:30. As with the bike, they checked wristbands before letting anyone in. I took about 10 minutes to get everything organized and visualize how I&rsquo;d move through the zone.</p>\n<h2 id=\"swim\">Swim</h2>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<p>Although the novelty might wear off after a few more races, standing on a beach with 2,000 other people along with a strong mix of excitement and anxiety is quite the experience. People were in and out of the lake to get in a warmup swim before the start and then the national anthem played just before 7. The pro men started right at 7, followed by the pro women at 7:05, and then the rest of us started at 7:10. We were all self organized into corrals of different expected finish times and I aimed for the back end of the 34-37 minute corral.</p>\n<p>Rather than one big mass start, there was a gate system at the start of the swim that let six swimmers through every 10 seconds. This kept a steady stream of swimmers going through the start without a giant crowd. The only downside was that it took a while to clear the beach. The pro men had already started their bike rides before I&rsquo;d even left the beach! I crossed the start line at 7:32.</p>\n<p>Not much to say about the swim. The water was a nice, cool temperature and there were only a few spots around the half-way point where there was any significant contact with other swimmers. This was mostly because at that point we were swimming directly into the sun and seeing the buoys was really challenging. We all just kept swimming forward, assuming that anyone in front of us was headed in roughly the right direction and it all worked out.</p>\n<p>I saw at least three people getting hauled out of the water by the safety teams that were paddling around in canoes and kayaks. I can only imagine how difficult it would be to need to quit the race so early, but safety is so much more important than pushing through and risking serious injury.</p>\n<p>One challenge I had with the <a href=\"https://matt.routleynet.org/2022/06/05/a-big-thank.html\">Milton sprint triathlon</a> was significant dizziness at the end of the swim and, consequently, a challenge getting through T1 on the bike. So, this time I slowed down near the end of the swim and tried to more carefully move from vertical to horizontal while getting out of the water. This seemed to help; although I still felt a bit light-headed, it wasn&rsquo;t nearly as bad as last time.</p>\n<p>33 minutes for the swim was faster than I&rsquo;d planned, though I felt good throughout. So, I wasn&rsquo;t worried.</p>\n<p>The swim ended with a 200m run into the transition zone. During this, I was able to wiggle out of the top half of my wetsuit, in preparation for the rest of the transition. Once I was at my transition spot, I pulled off the wetsuit and quickly consumed one <a href=\"https://endurancetap.com/products/caffeinated-energy-gel-can\">caffeinated gel</a>. Then helmet on (they&rsquo;re really strict about not touching your bike without a helmet on), bike shoes on, and grabbed the bike to run out to the bike mount line.</p>\n<h2 id=\"bike\">Bike</h2>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<p>The bike course was gorgeous. Lots of hills through Canadian Shield and forests on (mostly) smooth asphalt. There was a really steep downhill around km 16 that got me up to about 79 km/h and, since this was part of a loop, I also had to climb back up this hill on the way back. I&rsquo;d been worried about this when looking at the map. But, in the end, it wasn&rsquo;t so bad. I knew it was coming and just had to power through. The part that surprised me was the undulating hills in the last third. Despite the great scenery, these were really hard!</p>\n<p>My coach had advised I keep my heart rate around 155 throughout the bike course. Other than a few of the climbs, I was able to stick to this. It was actually really helpful to have a specific target to keep trying to hit. Three hours on the bike can get rather tedious without something to focus on and there&rsquo;s always a worry about pushing too hard on the bike and blowing up on the run.</p>\n<p>There were four aid stations on the bike course. Given the heat warning, at each one I grabbed a 750mL bottle of water. 2/3rds of the water I sprayed onto my head for cooling, the rest I drank. They had kids at the end of each aid station with hockey nets and sticks. You threw the empty bottle towards the net and they stick handled them in for disposal.</p>\n<p>I also had a 750mL bottle of electrolytes and 500mL bottle of water on the bike that I consumed throughout, along with two <a href=\"https://endurancetap.com/products/stroopwafel?ref=yotpo_94\">Stroopwafels</a> and two <a href=\"https://endurancetap.com/products/classic-energy-gel-can?ref=yotpo_94\">energy gels</a>.</p>\n<p>2 hours and 56 minutes on the bike was a few minutes faster than I&rsquo;d anticipated. So, also happy with this. By the end of the 90km, my legs felt reasonably fresh, but I was glad to get off the bike. Things were starting to get pretty uncomfortable. This might partly have been because it was actually my first ever ride with aero bars. I wouldn&rsquo;t recommend waiting until a race to try these out, though that was how it worked out for me. Overall, I&rsquo;d say the aero bars were more comfortable than I&rsquo;d expected, I just wasn&rsquo;t used to them.</p>\n<h2 id=\"run\">Run</h2>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<p>T2 was straightforward. I racked my bike, took off my helmet, and switched to running shoes and a hat. One more caffeinated gel and off I went.</p>\n<p>My plan was to maintain a 5:30 minutes/km pace for the run with an emphasis on keeping it slow after the bike transition (it is really tempting to start running fast off the bike). This was sustainable for about the first half. By the second half, though, the heat really started catching up with me and I had to slow down to around 6 minutes/km. I was super sensitive about pushing too hard in the heat and, consequently, jeopardizing actually finishing the race. So, I wasn&rsquo;t upset about slowing down. I did see at least two people off to the side of the course being attended by medics with apparent heat stroke, which were good reminders to pace carefully.</p>\n<p>I&rsquo;d committed to myself before the race that I would walk through each of the 12 aid stations. At each one, one water went onto my head, another I drank, and then I grabbed a couple of cups of ice. I had a small ziplock bag that I put ice in to hold, while the other ice went down the front of the Triathlon suit. Like me, many of the runners were making lots of jiggling noises as the ice that had fallen down into our shorts bounced around. Absolutely necessary though, given the heat and humidity.</p>\n<p>For nutrition on the run, I had two gels: one at about the 10km mark and the other around 15 km.</p>\n<p>The run course was also gorgeous. We ran through a decommissioned rail road track converted to a multi-use recreational path through the heart of the Laurentians that included waterfalls and forested areas. Although not as shaded as I&rsquo;d hoped, the course was great. There were also a few spots with sprinklers or fire hydrants spraying water. These were helpful for cooling down. I was particularly amused by the local resident that was lounging in a lawn chair with a beer in one hand and hose in the other. A bit of eye contact and thumbs up was all you needed to have him hose you down on the way by: so refreshing!</p>\n<p>Kilometres 14 to 17 were pretty tough. I was far enough along to be pretty tired, but not yet quite far enough to know that it was almost over. Knowing my family was at the end, ready to cheer me on really helped here.</p>\n<p>The last km of the run was an extra experience. You run right down the hill through the middle of the Tremblant village with spectators cheering you on from either side. Despite all the hard work up to this point, you really feel pretty energized for this part, especially when you finally see the finish line up ahead.</p>\n<p>2 hours and 3 minutes for the run was just a few minutes slower than I&rsquo;d anticipated. I was totally happy with this time, given everything that preceded it and the heat.</p>\n<h2 id=\"post-race\">Post-race</h2>\n<p>The finish line funnels you into a big tent with picnic benches. There were plenty of cold drinks available, along with a plate filled with pasta and french fries. I grabbed a couple of waters and then made my way out of the tent to see my family. I was pretty focused on that point with seeing them and then getting into the lake to cool down.</p>\n<p>My main goal had been to finish the race. That was accomplished. My second goal was to be in the top half of finishers. I managed to be in the top 1/3 for my age group and top 1/2 overall. So, I was very happy with my overall results.</p>\n<p>I felt that I executed the race well. No issues with hydration or nutrition, along with an intentionally conservative level of effort to maximize my chances of finishing the race worked out well.</p>\n<p>Two minor lessons learned: more sunscreen, I burned the back of my shoulders pretty thoroughly; and some more lubrication under the zipper of the Triathlon suit, I still have a pretty good friction burn in the middle of my chest.</p>\n",

Although not as shaded as I'd hoped, the course was great. There were also a few spots with sprinklers or fire hydrants spraying water. These were helpful for cooling down. I was particularly amused by the local resident that was lounging in a lawn chair with a beer in one hand and hose in the other. A bit of eye contact and thumbs up was all you needed to have him hose you down on the way by: so refreshing!\n\nKilometres 14 to 17 were pretty tough. I was far enough along to be pretty tired, but not yet quite far enough to know that it was almost over. Knowing my family was at the end, ready to cheer me on really helped here. \n\nThe last km of the run was an extra experience. You run right down the hill through the middle of the Tremblant village with spectators cheering you on from either side. Despite all the hard work up to this point, you really feel pretty energized for this part, especially when you finally see the finish line up ahead.\n\n2 hours and 3 minutes for the run was just a few minutes slower than I'd anticipated. I was totally happy with this time, given everything that preceded it and the heat.\n\n## Post-race\n\nThe finish line funnels you into a big tent with picnic benches. There were plenty of cold drinks available, along with a plate filled with pasta and french fries. I grabbed a couple of waters and then made my way out of the tent to see my family. I was pretty focused on that point with seeing them and then getting into the lake to cool down.\n\nMy main goal had been to finish the race. That was accomplished. My second goal was to be in the top half of finishers. I managed to be in the top 1/3 for my age group and top 1/2 overall. So, I was very happy with my overall results.\n\nI felt that I executed the race well. No issues with hydration or nutrition, along with an intentionally conservative level of effort to maximize my chances of finishing the race worked out well.\n\nTwo minor lessons learned: more sunscreen, I burned the back of my shoulders pretty thoroughly; and some more lubrication under the zipper of the Triathlon suit, I still have a pretty good friction burn in the middle of my chest.\n",

				"content_html": "<p>In preparation for <a href=\"https://matt.routleynet.org/2021/12/14/after-likely-too.html\">Tremblant</a>, I had my <a href=\"https://oneacademylife.com/wellness/\">gait analyzed</a> to find out if there are any issues with my running form. I found the process surprisingly thorough and interesting.</p>\n<p>Katie (a registered physiotherapist) started out with a general discussion about my running history and goals. Then she filmed me running on a treadmill for about five minutes. We set a fast pace, since that quickly exposes any sloppiness in my running. I have to admit that watching myself running in slow motion was a bit awkward, though my form wasn&rsquo;t as bad as I&rsquo;d imagined.</p>\n<p>Katie identified two issues: too much side to side rotation of my arms and a pronounced dip on my left side.</p>\n<p>The arms are pretty easy.

				"content_text": "In preparation for [Tremblant](https://matt.routleynet.org/2021/12/14/after-likely-too.html), I had my [gait analyzed](https://oneacademylife.com/wellness/) to find out if there are any issues with my running form. I found the process surprisingly thorough and interesting.\n\nKatie (a registered physiotherapist) started out with a general discussion about my running history and goals. Then she filmed me running on a treadmill for about five minutes. We set a fast pace, since that quickly exposes any sloppiness in my running. I have to admit that watching myself running in slow motion was a bit awkward, though my form wasn't as bad as I'd imagined.\n\nKatie identified two issues: too much side to side rotation of my arms and a pronounced dip on my left side. \n\nThe arms are pretty easy.

So, we decided to build a PC from components. \n\nI’d last built a PC about 30 years ago, when I wasn’t much older than him. I remember thinking it was cool to be using a machine I’d built myself, plus as a parent it seemed like a good educational experience.

				"content_text": "Inspired by [Coretex](https://overcast.fm/+E7b4kA8-g), I’m declaring **Tangible** as my theme for 2021.\n\nI’ve chosen this theme because I want to spend less time looking at a screen and more time with \"tangible stuff”. I’m sure that this is a common sentiment and declaring this theme will keep me focused on improvements.\n\nSince working from home with an iPad, I’m averaging about 9 hours a day with an iOS device. This isn’t just a vague estimate; Screen Time gives me to-the-minute tracking of every app I’m actively using.\n\nA generic day is something like:\n\n1.\t[Exercise](https://www.litethriive.com) via Zoom in the morning\n2.\tMeditate with [Waking Up](https://www.wakingup.com/) on the iPhone\n3.\tRead [news](https://ranchero.com/netnewswire/) on my iPad while having breakfast\n4.\tBack and forth between Teams (almost 3 hours a day!) and Outlook on the iPad throughout the work day\n5.\t[Learning guitar](https://youtube.com/c/andycrowley) on YouTube and reading books in the iPad in the evening\n\nThrow in some Netflix, journaling in [DayOne](https://dayoneapp.com), [social networking](https://micro.blog), and [random YouTube videos](https://youtube.com/greymatter) and I’m spending an incredible amount of time looking at a screen. \n\nI’m certainly not a Luddite! The ability of these rectangles of glass to take on so many functions and provide so much meaningful content is astounding. There’s just something unsettling about the dominant role they play.\n\nSo, a few things I plan to try:\n\n- Although I’ll continue reading ebooks, since the convenience is so great, I’ll be rotating paper books into the queue regularly. \n- I’ve lost my running outdoor routine. Getting that back will be a nice addition to the Zoom classes and add in some very much needed fresh air.\n- As a family, we’ve been enjoying playing board games on weekends, just not routinely. Making sure we play at least one game a week will be good for all of us.\n- My son is keen on electronics. We’re going to try assembling a gaming PC for him from components, as well as learn some basic electronics with a breadboard and Arduino.\n- Our dog will be excited to get out for more regular walks with especially long ones on the weekend.\n\nI’ll be adding much of this to [Streaks](https://apps.apple.com/ca/app/streaks/id963034692), an app that I’ve found really helpful for building habits. I'll also add a \"tangible\" tag to my [time tracker](https://apps.apple.com/ca/app/timery-for-toggl/id1425368544) to quantify the shift. \n\nMy hope is that I can find the right balance of screen time and tangible activities with intention.\n",

Just a list of potential reading sources and each one starts up a [Timery](https://timeryapp.com/) timer, since I like to track how much time I'm reading.\n\nHere's a screenshot of the first few actions:\n\n![](https://matt.routleynet.org/uploads/2020/0b30d6cbb5.jpg)\n\nI like the bit of whimsy from using emoticons:\n\n- 📚 for [Apple Books](https://www.apple.com/apple-books/)\n- 💵 for [The Economist](https://www.economist.com/)\n- 📰 for [NetNewsWire](https://ranchero.com/netnewswire/)\n- 👓 for [Safari Reading List](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT200294)\n\nA nice feature of using a Shortcut for this is that I can add other actions, such as turning on Do Not Disturb or starting a specific playlist. I can also add and subtract reading sources over time, depending on my current habits. For example, the first one was [Libby](https://www.overdrive.com/apps/libby/) for a while, since I was reading lots of library books.\n\nThis is another example of how relatively simple Shortcuts can really help optimize how you use your iOS devices.\n",

				"content_text": "<p>My <a href=\"https://www.torqride.com/\">favourite spin studio</a> has put on a fitness challenge for 2019. It has many components, one of which is improving your performance by 3% over six weeks. I’ve taken on the challenge and am now worried that I don’t know how reasonable this increase actually is. So, a perfect excuse to extract my metrics and perform some excessive analysis.</p>\n<p>We start by importing a CSV file of my stats, taken from Torq’s website. We use <code>readr</code> for this and set the <code>col_types</code> in advance to specify the type for each column, as well as skip some extra columns with <code>col_skip</code>. I find doing this at the same time as the import, rather than later in the process, more direct and efficient. I also like the flexibility of the <code>col_date</code> import, where I can convert the source data (e.g., “Mon 11/02/19 - 6:10 AM”) into a format <a href=\"https://xkcd.com/1179/\">more useful for analysis</a> (e.g., “2019-02-11”).</p>\n<p>One last bit of clean up is to specify the instructors that have led 5 or more sessions. Later, we’ll try to identify an instructor-effect on my performance and only 5 of the 10 instructors have sufficient data for such an analysis. The <code>forcats::fct_other</code> function is really handy for this: it collapses several factor levels together into one “Other” level.</p>\n<p>Lastly, I set the <code>challenge_start_date</code> variable for use later on.</p>\n<pre class=\"R\"><code>col_types = cols(\n  Date = col_date(format = \"%a %d/%m/%y - %H:%M %p\"),\n  Ride = col_skip(),\n  Instructor = col_character(),\n  Spot = col_skip(),\n  `Avg RPM` = col_skip(),\n  `Max RPM` = col_skip(),\n  `Avg Power` = col_double(),\n  `Max Power` = col_double(),\n  `Total Energy` = col_double(),\n  `Dist.

Given relatively high variability from class to class, we add a smoothed line to show the overall trend. We also mark the point where the challenge starts with a red line.</p>\n<pre class=\"r\"><code>ggplot2::ggplot(data, aes(x = Date, y = avg_power)) +\n  ggplot2::geom_point() +\n  ggplot2::geom_line() +\n  geom_smooth(method = \"loess\") +\n  ggplot2::ylab(\"Average power\") +\n  ggplot2::geom_vline(xintercept = challenge_start_date, col = \"red\")</code></pre>\n<p><img src=\"https://matt.routleynet.org/uploads/2019/f229b3bab4.png\" width=\"672\" /></p>\n<p>Overall, looks like I made some steady progress when I started, plateaued in the Summer (when I didn’t ride as often), and then started a slow, steady increase in the Fall. Unfortunately for me, it also looks like I started to plateau in my improvement just in time for the challenge.</p>\n<p>We’ll start a more formal analysis by just testing to see what my average improvement is over time.</p>\n<pre class=\"r\"><code>time_model <- lm(avg_power ~ Date, data = data)\nsummary(time_model)</code></pre>\n<pre><code>## \n## Call:\n## lm(formula = avg_power ~ Date, data = data)\n## \n## Residuals:\n##     Min      1Q  Median      3Q     Max \n## -30.486 -11.356  -1.879  11.501  33.838 \n## \n## Coefficients:\n##               Estimate Std.

But, interpreting the coefficient for time isn’t entirely intuitive and isn’t really the point of the challenge. The question is: how much higher is my average power during the challenge than before? For that, we’ll set up a “dummy variable” based on the date of the class. Then we use <code>dplyr</code> to group by this variable and estimate the mean of the average power in both time periods.</p>\n<pre class=\"r\"><code>data %<>% \n  dplyr::mutate(in_challenge = ifelse(Date > challenge_start_date, 1, 0)) \n(change_in_power <- data %>% \n  dplyr::group_by(in_challenge) %>% \n  dplyr::summarize(mean_avg_power = mean(avg_power)))</code></pre>\n<pre><code>## # A tibble: 2 x 2\n##   in_challenge mean_avg_power\n##          <dbl>          <dbl>\n## 1            0           213.\n## 2            1           231.</code></pre>\n<p>So, I’ve improved from an average power of 213 to 231 for a improvement of 8%. A great relief: I’ve exceeded the target!</p>\n<p>Of course, having gone to all of this (excessive?) trouble, now I’m interested in seeing if the instructor leading the class has a significant impact on my results. I certainly feel as if some instructors are harder than others. But, is this supported by my actual results? As always, we start with a plot to get a visual sense of the data.</p>\n<pre class=\"r\"><code>ggplot2::ggplot(data, aes(x = Date, y = avg_power)) +\n  ggplot2::geom_point() +\n  ggplot2::geom_line() +\n  ggplot2::geom_smooth(method = \"lm\", se = FALSE) +\n  ggplot2::facet_wrap(~Instructor) +\n  ggplot2::ylab(\"Average power\")</code></pre>\n<p><img src=\"https://matt.routleynet.org/uploads/2019/8e09c63772.png\" width=\"672\" /></p>\n<p>There’s a mix of confirmation and rejection of my expectations here:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Charlotte got me started and there’s a clear trend of increasing power as I figure out the bikes and gain fitness</li>\n<li>George’s class is always fun, but my progress isn’t as high as I’d like (indicated by the shallower slope). This is likely my fault though: George’s rides are almost always Friday morning and I’m often tired by then and don’t push myself as hard as I could</li>\n<li>Justine hasn’t led many of my classes, but my two best results are with her. That said, my last two rides with her haven’t been great</li>\n<li>Marawan’s classes always feel really tough. He’s great at motivation and I always feel like I’ve pushed really hard in his classes. You can sort of see this with the relatively higher position of the best fit line for his classes. But, I also had one really poor class with him. This seems to coincide with some poor classes with both Tanis and George though. So, I was likely a bit sick then. Also, for Marawan, I’m certain I’ve had more classes with him (each one is memorably challenging), as he’s substituted for other instructors several times. Looks like Torq’s tracker doesn’t adjust the name of the instructor to match this substitution though</li>\n<li>Tanis’ classes are usually tough too. She’s relentless about increasing resistance and looks like I was improving well with her</li>\n<li>Other isn’t really worth describing in any detail, as it is a mix of 5 other instructors each with different styles.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Having eye-balled the charts. Let’s now look at a statistical model that considers just instructors.</p>\n<pre class=\"r\"><code>instructor_model <- update(time_model, . ~ Instructor)\nsummary(instructor_model)</code></pre>\n<pre><code>## \n## Call:\n## lm(formula = avg_power ~ Instructor, data = data)\n## \n## Residuals:\n##     Min      1Q  Median      3Q     Max \n## -44.167 -10.590   0.663  13.540  32.000 \n## \n## Coefficients:\n##                   Estimate Std.

This suggests that controlling for instructor improves the time signal. However, when we add in time, none of the individual instructors are significantly different from each other.

Nonetheless, the earlier analysis of the instructors gave me some insights that I can use to maximize the contribution each of them makes to my overall progress.

Before getting too excited though, an ANOVA shows that this model isn’t any better than the simple model of just time. There’s always a risk with trying to explain main effects (like time) with interactions. The story here is really that we need more data to tease out the impacts of the instructor by time effect.</p>\n<p>The last point to make is that we’ve focused so far on the average power, since that’s the metric for this fitness challenge. There could be interesting interactions among average power, maximum power, RPMs, and total energy, each of which is available in these data. I’ll return to that analysis some other time.</p>\n<p>In the interests of science, I’ll keep going to these classes, just so we can figure out what impact instructors have on performance. In the meantime, looks like I’ll succeed with at least this component of the fitness challenge and I have the stats to prove it.</p>\n",

				"content_text": "<p>This is a “behind the scenes” elaboration of the geospatial analysis in our <a href=\"http://www.psephoanalytics.ca/2018/11/reviewing-our-2018-mayoral-race.html\">recent post</a> on evaluating our predictions for the 2018 mayoral election in Toronto. This was my first, serious use of the new <a href=\"https://r-spatial.github.io/sf/\"><code>sf</code> package</a> for geospatial analysis. I found the package much easier to use than some of my previous workflows for this sort of analysis, especially given its integration with the <a href=\"https://www.tidyverse.org/\">tidyverse</a>.</p>\n<p>We start by downloading the <a href=\"https://www.toronto.ca/city-government/data-research-maps/open-data/open-data-catalogue/#370e7072-0ba7-e477-121e-78ba5dac9649\">shapefile for voting locations</a> from the City of Toronto’s <a href=\"https://www.toronto.ca/city-government/data-research-maps/open-data/\">Open Data portal</a> and reading it with the <code>read_sf</code> function. Then, we pipe it to <code>st_transform</code> to set the appropriate <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Map_projection\">projection</a> for the data. In this case, this isn’t strictly necessary, since the shapefile is already in the right projection. But, I tend to do this for all shapefiles to avoid any oddities later.</p>\n\n```R\ndownload.file(\"http://opendata.toronto.ca/gcc/voting_location_2018_wgs84.zip\",\n                destfile = \"data-raw/voting_location_2018_wgs84.zip\", quiet = TRUE)\nunzip(\"data-raw/voting_location_2018_wgs84.zip\", exdir=\"data-raw/voting_location_2018_wgs84\")\ntoronto_locations <- sf::read_sf(\"data-raw/voting_location_2018_wgs84\", \n                                 layer = \"VOTING_LOCATION_2018_WGS84\") %>%\n  sf::st_transform(crs = \"+init=epsg:4326\")\ntoronto_locations\n```\n```R\n## Simple feature collection with 1700 features and 13 fields\n## geometry type:  POINT\n## dimension:      XY\n## bbox:           xmin: -79.61937 ymin: 43.59062 xmax: -79.12531 ymax: 43.83052\n## epsg (SRID):    4326\n## proj4string:    +proj=longlat +datum=WGS84 +no_defs\n## # A tibble: 1,700 x 14\n##    POINT_ID FEAT_CD FEAT_C_DSC PT_SHRT_CD PT_LNG_CD POINT_NAME VOTER_CNT\n##       <dbl> <chr>   <chr>      <chr>      <chr>     <chr>          <int>\n##  1    10190 P       Primary    056        10056     <NA>              37\n##  2    10064 P       Primary    060        10060     <NA>             532\n##  3    10999 S       Secondary  058        10058     Malibu           661\n##  4    11342 P       Primary    052        10052     <NA>            1914\n##  5    10640 P       Primary    047        10047     The Summit       956\n##  6    10487 S       Secondary  061        04061     White Eag…        51\n##  7    11004 P       Primary    063        04063     Holy Fami…      1510\n##  8    11357 P       Primary    024        11024     Rosedale …      1697\n##  9    12044 P       Primary    018        05018     Weston Pu…      1695\n## 10    11402 S       Secondary  066        04066     Elm Grove…        93\n## # ... with 1,690 more rows, and 7 more variables: OBJECTID <dbl>,\n## #   ADD_FULL <chr>, X <dbl>, Y <dbl>, LONGITUDE <dbl>, LATITUDE <dbl>,\n## #   geometry <POINT [°]>\n```\n\n<p>The file has 1700 rows of data across 14 columns. The first 13 columns are data within the original shapefile. The last column is a <a href=\"https://www.rstudio.com/resources/videos/how-to-work-with-list-columns/\">list column</a> that is added by <code>sf</code> and contains the geometry of the location. This specific design feature is what makes an <code>sf</code> object work really well with the rest of the tidyverse: the geographical details are just a column in the data frame. This makes the data much easier to work with than in other approaches, where the data is contained within an <code>[@data](https://micro.blog/data)</code> slot of an object.</p>\n<p>Plotting the data is straightforward, since <code>sf</code> objects have a <code>plot</code> function. Here’s an example where we plot the number of voters (<code>VOTER_CNT</code>) at each location. If you squint just right, you can see the general outline of Toronto in these points.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://matt.routleynet.org/uploads/2019/c1f3d1400b.png\" width=\"672\" /></p>\n<p>What we want to do next is use the voting location data to aggregate the votes cast at each location into census tracts. This then allows us to associate census characteristics (like age and income) with the pattern of votes and develop our statistical relationships for predicting voter behaviour.</p>\n<p>We’ll split this into several steps. The first is downloading and reading the census tract shapefile.</p>\n\n```R\ndownload.file(\"http://www12.statcan.gc.ca/census-recensement/2011/geo/bound-limit/files-fichiers/gct_000b11a_e.zip\",\n                destfile = \"data-raw/gct_000b11a_e.zip\", quiet = TRUE)\nunzip(\"data-raw/gct_000b11a_e.zip\", exdir=\"data-raw/gct\")\ncensus_tracts <- sf::read_sf(\"data-raw/gct\", layer = \"gct_000b11a_e\") %>%\n  sf::st_transform(crs = \"+init=epsg:4326\")\n```\n\n<p>Now that we have it, all we really want are the census tracts in Toronto (the shapefile includes census tracts across Canada). We achieve this by intersecting the Toronto voting locations with the census tracts using standard R subsetting notation.</p>\n\n```R\nto_census_tracts <- census_tracts[toronto_locations,] \n```\n\n<p>And, we can plot it to see how well the intersection worked. This time we’ll plot the CTUID, which is the unique identifier for each census tract. This doesn’t mean anything in this context, but adds some nice colour to the plot.</p>\n\n```R \nplot(to_census_tracts[\"CTUID\"])\n```\n\n<p><img src=\"https://matt.routleynet.org/uploads/2019/22d42cb3c3.png\" width=\"672\" /></p>\n<p>Now you can really see the shape of Toronto, as well as the size of each census tract.</p>\n<p>Next we need to manipulate the voting data to get votes received by major candidates in the 2018 election. We take these data from the <a href=\"https://github.com/Psepho/toVotes\"><code>toVotes</code> package</a> and arbitrarily set the threshold for major candidates to receiving at least 100,000 votes. This yields our two main candidates: John Tory and Jennifer Keesmaat.</p>\n\n```R\nmajor_candidates <- toVotes %>% \n  dplyr::filter(year == 2018) %>%\n  dplyr::group_by(candidate) %>%\n  dplyr::summarise(votes = sum(votes)) %>%\n  dplyr::filter(votes > 100000) %>%\n  dplyr::select(candidate)\nmajor_candidates\n```\n\n```R\n## # A tibble: 2 x 1\n##   candidate        \n##   <chr>            \n## 1 Keesmaat Jennifer\n## 2 Tory John\n```\n\n<p>Given our goal of aggregating the votes received by each candidate into census tracts, we need a data frame that has each candidate in a separate column. We start by joining the major candidates table to the votes table. In this case, we also filter the votes to 2018, since John Tory has been a candidate in more than one election. Then we use the <code>tidyr</code> package to convert the table from long (with one candidate column) to wide (with a column for each candidate).</p>\n\n```R \nspread_votes <- toVotes %>%\n  tibble::as.tibble() %>% \n  dplyr::filter(year == 2018) %>%\n  dplyr::right_join(major_candidates) %>%\n  dplyr::select(-type, -year) %>%\n  tidyr::spread(candidate, votes)\nspread_votes \n```\n\n```R \n## # A tibble: 1,800 x 4\n##     ward  area `Keesmaat Jennifer` `Tory John`\n##    <int> <int>               <dbl>       <dbl>\n##  1     1     1                  66         301\n##  2     1     2                  72         376\n##  3     1     3                  40         255\n##  4     1     4                  24         161\n##  5     1     5                  51         211\n##  6     1     6                  74         372\n##  7     1     7                  70         378\n##  8     1     8                  10          77\n##  9     1     9                  11          82\n## 10     1    10                  12          76\n## # ... with 1,790 more rows\n```\n\n<p>Our last step before finally aggregating to census tracts is to join the <code>spread_votes</code> table with the <code>toronto_locations</code> data. This requires pulling the ward and area identifiers from the <code>PT_LNG_CD</code> column of the <code>toronto_locations</code> data frame which we do with some <code>stringr</code> functions. While we’re at it, we also update the candidate names to just surnames.</p>\n\n```R\nto_geo_votes <- toronto_locations %>%\n  dplyr::mutate(ward = as.integer(stringr::str_sub(PT_LNG_CD, 1, 2)),\n                area = as.integer(stringr::str_sub(PT_LNG_CD, -3, -1))) %>%\n  dplyr::left_join(spread_votes) %>%\n  dplyr::select(`Keesmaat Jennifer`, `Tory John`) %>%\n  dplyr::rename(Keesmaat = `Keesmaat Jennifer`, Tory = `Tory John`)\nto_geo_votes\n```\n\n```R\n## Simple feature collection with 1700 features and 2 fields\n## geometry type:  POINT\n## dimension:      XY\n## bbox:           xmin: -79.61937 ymin: 43.59062 xmax: -79.12531 ymax: 43.83052\n## epsg (SRID):    4326\n## proj4string:    +proj=longlat +datum=WGS84 +no_defs\n## # A tibble: 1,700 x 3\n##    Keesmaat  Tory             geometry\n##       <dbl> <dbl>          <POINT [°]>\n##  1       55   101 (-79.40225 43.63641)\n##  2       43    53  (-79.3985 43.63736)\n##  3       61    89 (-79.40028 43.63664)\n##  4      296   348 (-79.39922 43.63928)\n##  5      151   204 (-79.40401 43.64293)\n##  6        2    11 (-79.43941 43.63712)\n##  7      161   174 (-79.43511 43.63869)\n##  8      221   605  (-79.38188 43.6776)\n##  9       68   213 (-79.52078 43.70176)\n## 10        4    14 (-79.43094 43.64027)\n## # ... with 1,690 more rows\n```\n\n<p>Okay, we’re finally there. We have our census tract data in <code>to_census_tracts</code> and our voting data in <code>to_geo_votes</code>. We want to aggregate the votes into each census tract by summing the votes at each voting location within each census tract. We use the <code>aggregate</code> function for this.</p>\n\n```R\nct_votes_wide <- aggregate(x = to_geo_votes, \n                           by = to_census_tracts, \n                           FUN = sum)\nct_votes_wide\n```\n\n```R\n## Simple feature collection with 522 features and 2 fields\n## geometry type:  MULTIPOLYGON\n## dimension:      XY\n## bbox:           xmin: -79.6393 ymin: 43.58107 xmax: -79.11547 ymax: 43.85539\n## epsg (SRID):    4326\n## proj4string:    +proj=longlat +datum=WGS84 +no_defs\n## First 10 features:\n##    Keesmaat Tory                       geometry\n## 1       407  459 MULTIPOLYGON (((-79.39659 4...\n## 2      1103 2400 MULTIPOLYGON (((-79.38782 4...\n## 3       403 1117 MULTIPOLYGON (((-79.27941 4...\n## 4        96  570 MULTIPOLYGON (((-79.28156 4...\n## 5       169  682 MULTIPOLYGON (((-79.49104 4...\n## 6       121  450 MULTIPOLYGON (((-79.54422 4...\n## 7        42   95 MULTIPOLYGON (((-79.45379 4...\n## 8       412  512 MULTIPOLYGON (((-79.33895 4...\n## 9        83  132 MULTIPOLYGON (((-79.35427 4...\n## 10       92  629 MULTIPOLYGON (((-79.44554 4...]\n```\n\n<p>As a last step, to tidy up, we now convert the wide table with a column for each candidate into a long table that has just one candidate column containing the name of the candidate.</p>\n\n```R \nct_votes <- tidyr::gather(ct_votes_wide, candidate, votes, -geometry)\nct_votes\n```\n\n```R\n## Simple feature collection with 1044 features and 2 fields\n## geometry type:  MULTIPOLYGON\n## dimension:      XY\n## bbox:           xmin: -79.6393 ymin: 43.58107 xmax: -79.11547 ymax: 43.85539\n## epsg (SRID):    4326\n## proj4string:    +proj=longlat +datum=WGS84 +no_defs\n## First 10 features:\n##    candidate votes                       geometry\n## 1   Keesmaat   407 MULTIPOLYGON (((-79.39659 4...\n## 2   Keesmaat  1103 MULTIPOLYGON (((-79.38782 4...\n## 3   Keesmaat   403 MULTIPOLYGON (((-79.27941 4...\n## 4   Keesmaat    96 MULTIPOLYGON (((-79.28156 4...\n## 5   Keesmaat   169 MULTIPOLYGON (((-79.49104 4...\n## 6   Keesmaat   121 MULTIPOLYGON (((-79.54422 4...\n## 7   Keesmaat    42 MULTIPOLYGON (((-79.45379 4...\n## 8   Keesmaat   412 MULTIPOLYGON (((-79.33895 4...\n## 9   Keesmaat    83 MULTIPOLYGON (((-79.35427 4...\n## 10  Keesmaat    92 MULTIPOLYGON (((-79.44554 4...\n```\n\n<p>Now that we have votes aggregated by census tract, we can add in many other attributes from the census data. We won’t do that here, since this post is already pretty long. But, we’ll end with a plot to show how easily <code>sf</code> integrates with <code>ggplot2</code>. This is a nice improvement from past workflows, when several steps were required. In the actual <a href=\"https://github.com/Psepho/to2018retrospective/blob/master/compare_pred_actual_2018.Rmd\">code for the retrospective analysis</a>, I added some other plotting techniques, like cutting the response variable (votes) into equally spaced pieces and adding some more refined labels. Here, we’ll just produce a simple plot.</p>\n\n```R \nggplot2::ggplot(data = ct_votes) +\n  ggplot2::geom_sf(ggplot2::aes(fill = votes)) +\n  ggplot2::facet_wrap(~candidate)\n```\n\n<p><img src=\"https://matt.routleynet.org/uploads/2019/40fe117602.png\" width=\"672\" /></p>\n",

Although it was mildly clever, like any hack, I shouldn’t have relied on this one for long, as proven by Elections Ontario shutting down the website.</p>\n<p>So, a more robust solution was required, which led to using one of Election Ontario’s shapefiles. The shapefile contains the data we need, it’s just in a tricky format to deal with. But, the <code>sf</code> package makes this mostly straightforward.</p>\n<p>We start by downloading and importing the Elections Ontario shape file. Then, since we’re only interested in the City of Toronto boundaries, we download the city’s shapefile too and intersect it with the provincial one to get a subset:</p>\n<pre class=\"r\"><code>download.file(\"[www.elections.on.ca/content/d...](https://www.elections.on.ca/content/dam/NGW/sitecontent/2016/preo/shapefiles/Polling%20Division%20Shapefile%20-%202014%20General%20Election.zip)\", \n              destfile = \"data-raw/Polling%20Division%20Shapefile%20-%202014%20General%20Election.zip\")\nunzip(\"data-raw/Polling%20Division%20Shapefile%20-%202014%20General%20Election.zip\", \n      exdir = \"data-raw/Polling%20Division%20Shapefile%20-%202014%20General%20Election\")\n\nprov_geo <- sf::st_read(\"data-raw/Polling%20Division%20Shapefile%20-%202014%20General%20Election\", \n                        layer = \"PDs_Ontario\") %>%\n  sf::st_transform(crs = \"+init=epsg:4326\")\n\ndownload.file(\"[opendata.toronto.ca/gcc/votin...](http://opendata.toronto.ca/gcc/voting_location_2014_wgs84.zip)\",\n              destfile = \"data-raw/voting_location_2014_wgs84.zip\")\nunzip(\"data-raw/voting_location_2014_wgs84.zip\", exdir=\"data-raw/voting_location_2014_wgs84\")\ntoronto_wards <- sf::st_read(\"data-raw/voting_location_2014_wgs84\", layer = \"VOTING_LOCATION_2014_WGS84\") %>%\n  sf::st_transform(crs = \"+init=epsg:4326\")\n\nto_prov_geo <- prov_geo %>%\n  sf::st_intersection(toronto_wards)</code></pre>\n<p>Now we just need to extract a couple of columns from the data frame associated with the shapefile.

But the voting results are organized by Electoral District &lt;em&gt;number&lt;/em&gt;. I couldn’t find an appropriate resource on the Elections Ontario site. Rather, here we pull the names and numbers of the Electoral Districts from the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www3.elections.on.ca/internetapp/FYED_Error.aspx?lang=en-ca&quot;&gt;Find My Electoral District&lt;/a&gt; website. The xpath selector is a bit tricky for this one. The &lt;code&gt;ed_xpath&lt;/code&gt; object below actually pulls content from the drop down list that appears when you choose an Electoral District. One nuisance with these data is that Elections Ontario uses &lt;code&gt;--&lt;/code&gt; in the Electoral District names, instead of the — used on Wikipedia. We use &lt;code&gt;str_replace_all&lt;/code&gt; to fix this below.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;pre class=&quot;r&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;ed_webpage &lt;- &quot;https://www3.elections.on.ca/internetapp/FYED_Error.aspx?lang=en-ca&quot;\ned_xpath &lt;- &quot;//*[(@id = \\&quot;ddlElectoralDistricts\\&quot;)]&quot;

These are made available as a collection of Excel files in a compressed folder. To avoid downloading it more than once, we wrap the call in an &lt;code&gt;if&lt;/code&gt; statement that first checks to see if we already have the file. We also rename the file to something more manageable.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;pre class=&quot;r&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;raw_results_file &lt;- &quot;[www.elections.on.ca/content/d...](http://www.elections.on.ca/content/dam/NGW/sitecontent/2017/results/Poll%20by%20Poll%20Results%20-%20Excel.zip)&quot;\n\nzip_file &lt;- &quot;data-raw/Poll%20by%20Poll%20Results%20-%20Excel.zip&quot;\nif(file.exists(zip_file)) { # Only download the data once\n  # File exists, so nothing to do\n}  else {\n  download.file(raw_results_file,\n                destfile = zip_file)\n  unzip(zip_file, exdir=&quot;data-raw&quot;) # Extract the data into data-raw\n  file.rename(&quot;data-raw/GE Results - 2014 (unconverted)&quot;, &quot;data-raw/pollresults&quot;)\n}&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;\n&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;## NULL&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Now we need to extract the votes out of 107 Excel files. The combination of &lt;code&gt;purrr&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;readxl&lt;/code&gt; packages is great for this. In case we want to filter to just a few of the files (perhaps to target a range of Electoral Districts), we declare a &lt;code&gt;file_pattern&lt;/code&gt;. For now, we just set it to any xls file that ends with three digits preceeded by a “_“.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;As we read in the Excel files, we clean up lots of blank columns and headers.

But, I’m always happy to look more closely at data and provide some context for public debates.</p>\n<p>One major gap with this type of analysis is that we’re only looking at the median donations of people that donated anything at all. In other words, we aren’t considering anyone who donates nothing. We should really compare these median donations to the total population or the size of the economy. This <a href=\"http://www.statcan.gc.ca/pub/11-008-x/2012001/article/11637-eng.htm\">Stats Can</a> study is a much more thorough look at the issue.</p>\n<p>For me the interesting result here is the dramatic difference between Quebec and the rest of the provinces. But, I don’t interpret this to mean that Quebecers are less generous than the rest of Canada. Seems more likely that there are material differences in how the Quebec economy and social safety nets are structured.</p>\n",

In this case, it also helps us investigate one of the great, enduring mysteries: Is Friday the 13th actually an unlucky day?</p>\n<p>As always, we start by downloading and manipulating the data. I’ve added in two steps that aren’t strictly necessary. One is converting the Date, Time, and Day columns into a single Date column. The other is to drop most of the other columns of data, since we aren’t interested in them here.</p>\n\n```R\nurl <- \"http://www1.toronto.ca/City%20Of%20Toronto/Information%20&%20Technology/Open%20Data/Data%20Sets/Assets/Files/Subway%20&%20SRT%20Logs%20(Jan01_14%20to%20April30_17).xlsx\"\nfilename <- basename(url)\ndownload.file(url, destfile = filename, mode = \"wb\")\ndelays <- readxl::read_excel(filename, sheet = 2) %>% \n  dplyr::mutate(date = lubridate::ymd_hm(paste(`Date`, \n                                               `Time`, \n                                               sep = \" \")),\n                delay = `Min Delay`) %>% \n  dplyr::select(date, delay)\ndelays\n```\n\n```R\n## # A tibble: 69,043 x 2\n##                   date delay\n##                 <dttm> <dbl>\n##  1 2014-01-01 02:06:00     3\n##  2 2014-01-01 02:40:00     0\n##  3 2014-01-01 03:10:00     3\n##  4 2014-01-01 03:20:00     5\n##  5 2014-01-01 03:29:00     0\n##  6 2014-01-01 07:31:00     0\n##  7 2014-01-01 07:32:00     0\n##  8 2014-01-01 07:34:00     0\n##  9 2014-01-01 07:34:00     0\n## 10 2014-01-01 07:53:00     0\n## # ... with 69,033 more rows\n```\n\n<p>Now we have a <code>delays</code> dataframe with 69043 incidents starting from 2014-01-01 00:21:00 and ending at 2017-04-30 22:13:00. Before we get too far, we’ll take a look at the data. A heatmap of delays by day and hour should give us some perspective.</p>\n\n```R \ndelays %>% \n  dplyr::mutate(day = lubridate::day(date),\n         hour = lubridate::hour(date)) %>% \n  dplyr::group_by(day, hour) %>% \n  dplyr::summarise(sum_delay = sum(delay)) %>% \n  ggplot2::ggplot(aes(x = hour, y = day, fill = sum_delay)) +\n    ggplot2::geom_tile(alpha = 0.8, color = \"white\") +\n    ggplot2::scale_fill_gradient2() + \n    ggplot2::theme(legend.position = \"right\") +\n    ggplot2::labs(x = \"Hour\", y = \"Day of the month\", fill = \"Sum of delays\")\n```\n\n<p><img src=\"https://matt.routleynet.org/uploads/2019/6e78ebf230.png\" width=\"672\" /></p>\n<p>Other than a reliable band of calm very early in the morning, no obvious patterns here.</p>\n<p>We need to identify any days that are a Friday the 13th. We also might want to compare weekends, regular Fridays, other weekdays, and Friday the 13ths, so we add a <code>type</code> column that provides these values. Here we use the <code>case_when</code> function:</p>\n\n```R \ndelays <- delays %>% \n    dplyr::mutate(type = case_when( # Partition into Friday the 13ths, Fridays, weekends, and weekdays\n      lubridate::wday(.$date) %in% c(1, 7) ~ \"weekend\",\n      lubridate::wday(.$date) %in% c(6) & \n        lubridate::day(.$date) == 13 ~ \"Friday 13th\",\n      lubridate::wday(.$date) %in% c(6) ~ \"Friday\",\n      TRUE ~ \"weekday\" # Everything else is a weekday\n  )) %>% \n  dplyr::mutate(type = factor(type)) %>% \n  dplyr::group_by(type)\ndelays\n```\n\n```R\n## # A tibble: 69,043 x 3\n## # Groups:   type [4]\n##                   date delay    type\n##                 <dttm> <dbl>  <fctr>\n##  1 2014-01-01 02:06:00     3 weekday\n##  2 2014-01-01 02:40:00     0 weekday\n##  3 2014-01-01 03:10:00     3 weekday\n##  4 2014-01-01 03:20:00     5 weekday\n##  5 2014-01-01 03:29:00     0 weekday\n##  6 2014-01-01 07:31:00     0 weekday\n##  7 2014-01-01 07:32:00     0 weekday\n##  8 2014-01-01 07:34:00     0 weekday\n##  9 2014-01-01 07:34:00     0 weekday\n## 10 2014-01-01 07:53:00     0 weekday\n## # ... with 69,033 more rows\n```\n\n<p>With the data organized, we can start with just a simple box plot of the minutes of delay by <code>type</code>.</p>\n\n```R \nggplot2::ggplot(delays, aes(type, delay)) +\n  ggplot2::geom_boxplot() + \n  ggplot2::labs(x = \"Type\", y = \"Minutes of delay\")\n```\n\n<p><img src=\"https://matt.routleynet.org/uploads/2019/5f349287d0.png\" width=\"672\" /></p>\n<p>Not very compelling. Basically most delays are short (as in zero minutes long) with many outliers.</p>\n<p>How about if we summed up the total minutes in delays for each of the types of days?</p>\n\n```R \ndelays %>% \n  dplyr::summarise(total_delay = sum(delay)) \n```\n\n```R \n## # A tibble: 4 x 2\n##          type total_delay\n##        <fctr>       <dbl>\n## 1      Friday       18036\n## 2 Friday 13th         619\n## 3     weekday       78865\n## 4     weekend       28194\n```\n\n<p>Clearly the total minutes of delays are much shorter for Friday the 13ths. But, there aren’t very many such days (only 6 in fact). So, this is a dubious analysis.</p>\n<p>Let’s take a step back and calculate the average of the total delay across the entire day for each of the types of days. If Friday the 13ths really are unlucky, we would expect to see longer delays, at least relative to a regular Friday.</p>\n\n```R \ndaily_delays <- delays %>% # Total delays in a day\n  dplyr::mutate(year = lubridate::year(date),\n                day = lubridate::yday(date)) %>% \n  dplyr::group_by(year, day, type) %>% \n  dplyr::summarise(total_delay = sum(delay))\n\nmean_daily_delays <- daily_delays %>% # Average delays in each type of day\n  dplyr::group_by(type) %>% \n  dplyr::summarise(avg_delay = mean(total_delay))\nmean_daily_delays\n```\n\n```R\n## # A tibble: 4 x 2\n##          type avg_delay\n##        <fctr>     <dbl>\n## 1      Friday 107.35714\n## 2 Friday 13th 103.16667\n## 3     weekday 113.63833\n## 4     weekend  81.01724\n```\n\n```R\nggplot2::ggplot(daily_delays, aes(type, total_delay)) +\n  ggplot2::geom_boxplot() + \n  ggplot2::labs(x = \"Type\", y = \"Total minutes of delay\")\n```\n\n<p><img src=\"https://matt.routleynet.org/uploads/2019/fffb3b2834.png\" width=\"672\" /></p>\n<p>On average, Friday the 13ths have shorter total delays (103 minutes) than either regular Fridays (107 minutes) or other weekdays (114 minutes). Overall, weekend days have far shorter total delays (81 minutes).</p>\n<p>If Friday the 13ths are unlucky, they certainly aren’t causing longer TTC delays.</p>\n<p>For the statisticians among you that still aren’t convinced, we’ll run a basic linear model to compare Friday the 13ths with regular Fridays. This should control for many unmeasured variables.</p>\n\n```R \nmodel <- lm(total_delay ~ type, data = daily_delays, \n            subset = type %in% c(\"Friday\", \"Friday 13th\"))\nsummary(model)\n```\n\n```R\n## \n## Call:\n## lm(formula = total_delay ~ type, data = daily_delays, subset = type %in% \n##     c(\"Friday\", \"Friday 13th\"))\n## \n## Residuals:\n##      Min       1Q   Median       3Q      Max \n## -103.357  -30.357   -6.857   18.643  303.643 \n## \n## Coefficients:\n##                 Estimate Std. Error t value Pr(>|t|)    \n## (Intercept)      107.357      3.858  27.829   <2e-16 ***\n## typeFriday 13th   -4.190     20.775  -0.202     0.84    \n## ---\n## Signif. codes:  0 '***' 0.001 '**' 0.01 '*' 0.05 '.' 0.1 ' ' 1\n## \n## Residual standard error: 50 on 172 degrees of freedom\n## Multiple R-squared:  0.0002365,  Adjusted R-squared:  -0.005576 \n## F-statistic: 0.04069 on 1 and 172 DF,  p-value: 0.8404\n```\n\n<p>Definitely no statistical support for the idea that Friday the 13ths cause longer TTC delays.</p>\n<p>How about time series tests, like <a href=\"https://blog.statsbot.co/time-series-anomaly-detection-algorithms-1cef5519aef2\">anomaly detections</a>? Seems like we’d just be getting carried away. Part of the art of statistics is knowing when to quit.</p>\n<p>In conclusion, then, after likely far too much analysis, we find no evidence that Friday the 13ths cause an increase in the length of TTC delays. This certainly suggests that Friday the 13ths are not unlucky in any meaningful way, at least for TTC riders.</p>\n<p>Glad we could put this superstition to rest!</p>\n",

				"content_text": "<p>I recently participated in a panel discussion at the <a href=\"http://www.careers.utoronto.ca/\">University of Toronto</a> on the career transition from academic research to public service. I really enjoyed the discussion and there were many great questions from the audience. Here’s just a brief summary of some of the main points I tried to make about the differences between academics and public service.</p>\n\n<p>The major difference I’ve experienced involves a trade-off between control and influence.</p>\n\n<p>As a grad student and post-doctoral researcher I had almost complete control over my work. I could decide what was interesting, how to pursue questions, who to talk to, and when to work on specific components of my research. I believe that I made some <a href=\"http://files.me.com/mroutley/o38cwy\">important</a> <a href=\"http://files.me.com/mroutley/xura8h\">contributions</a> to my field of study. But, to be honest, this work had very little influence beyond a small group of colleagues who are also interested in the evolution of floral form.</p>\n\n<p>Now I want to be clear about this: in no way should this be interpreted to mean that scientific research is not important. This is how scientific progress is made – many scientists working on particular, specific questions that are aggregated into general knowledge. This work is important and deserves support. Plus, it was incredibly interesting and rewarding.</p>\n\n<p>However, the comparison of the influence of my academic research with my work on infrastructure policy is revealing. Roads, bridges, transit, hospitals, schools, courthouses, and jails all have <a href=\"http://www.mei.gov.on.ca/en/infrastructure/\">significant impacts</a> on the day-to-day experience of millions of people. Every day I am involved in decisions that determine where, when, and how the government will invest scarce resources into these important services.</p>\n\n<p>Of course, this is where the control-influence trade-off kicks in. As an individual public servant, I have very little control over these decisions or how my work will be used. Almost everything I do involves medium-sized teams with members from many departments and ministries. This requires extensive collaboration, often under very tight time constraints with high profile outcomes.</p>\n\n<p>For example, in my first week as a <a href=\"http://www.mei.gov.on.ca/\">public servant</a> I started a year-long process to integrate and enhance decision-making processes across 20 ministries and 2 agencies. The project team included engineers, policy analysts, accountants, lawyers, economists, and external consultants from all of the major government sectors. The (rather long) document produced by this process is now used to inform every infrastructure decision made by the province.</p>\n\n<p>Governments contend with really interesting and complicated problems that no one else can or will consider. Businesses generally take on the easy and profitable issues, while NGOs are able to focus on specific aspects of issues. Consequently, working on government policy provides a seemingly endless supply of challenges and puzzles to solve, or at least mitigate. I find this very rewarding.</p>\n\n<p>None of this is to suggest that either option is better than the other. I’ve been lucky to have had two very interesting careers so far, which have been at the opposite ends of this control-influence trade-off. Nonetheless, my experience suggests that an actual academic career is incredibly challenging to obtain and may require significant compromises. Public service can offer many of the same intellectual challenges with better job prospects and work-life balance. But, you need to be comfortable with the diminished control.</p>\n\n<p>Thanks to my colleague <a href=\"http://ca.linkedin.com/pub/andrew-miller/14/83a/148\">Andrew Miller</a> for creating the panel and inviting me to participate. The experience led me to think more clearly about my career choices and I think the panel was helpful to some University of Toronto grad students.</p>\n",

It was rewarding to hear so many U.K. public service leaders ask about Canadian reforms. It seems that public service managers around the world are looking carefully at leading practices emerging in Ottawa and the provinces, especially Ontario.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>One of the strange challenges I have as a public servant is the constant description of my colleagues as overpaid and underworked. The classic quote came from John Tory as leader of Ontario&rsquo;s opposition party:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>“These kinds of jobs are people who are breathing each other’s exhaust and sitting around, analyzing each other’s papers. There hasn’t been enough attention paid to looking at whether those people are really making a productive contribution to the effective delivery of public services in Ontario.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Of course, you can point to several studies showing how efficient Ontario&rsquo;s public servants are and how much the <a href=\"http://growinggap.ca/campaigns/public_spending\">public benefits</a> from government services, but people aren&rsquo;t interested in reviewing this kind of evidence. So, I&rsquo;m happy to see Tony Dean advocating for public servants. I think that strong advocacy from public servant leaders will help much more than statistics.</p>\n",

I had looked into using the Bettencourt paper (cited in this article) for making allocation decisions. The trick is moving from the general patterns observed in urban scaling to specific recommendations for where to invest in new infrastructure. This is particularly challenging in the absence of good, detailed data on the current infrastructure stock. We’ve made good progress on gathering some of this data, and it might be worth revisiting this scaling relationship.</p>\n",

Food production influences my health, has environmental consequences, and affects both urban and rural design. Ideally, I would develop relationships with local farmers, carefully choose organic produce, and always consider broad environmental impacts. Except, I like to spend time with my young family, try to get some exercise, and have more than enough commitments through work to actually spend this much effort on food choices. So, I’ve outsourced this process to the excellent <a href=\"http://www.mamaearth.ca/\">Mama Earth Organics</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Every week a basket of fresh organic and/or local fruit and vegetables arrives on our doorstep. Part of the fun of this service is that different items arrive each week, which diversifies our weekly food routine. But, we always know what’s coming several days in advance, so we can plan our meals well ahead of time. After over a year of service, we’ve only had a single complaint about quality and this was handled very quickly by Mama Earth with a full refund plus credit.</p>\n\n<p>We’ve found the small basket is sufficient for two adults and a picky four-year old. We’ve also added in some fresh bread from St. John’s Bakery, which has been consistently delicious and lasts through most of the week.</p>\n",

Citizens become confused and disinterested,\ncustomers become jaded, and people loose their love for language.\nAlso, as a public servant I see this kind of language every day and\noften find myself struggling to avoid banality and cliches (not to\nmention bullet points).  We need more forceful advocates like Don\nWatson to call out politicians and corporations for abusing our\nlanguage.  This book certainly makes me want to try harder.  And\nwhat’s more inspiring than struggling for a good cause against long\nodds?</p>\n\n<p>The book also has a great glossary of typical weasel words with possible synonyms. So, I’m keeping the book in my office for quick reference.</p>\n",

				"content_text": "<p>After seventeen years as a vegetarian, I recently switched back to an\nomnivore. My motivation for not eating meat was environmental, since,\non average, a vegetarian diet requires much less land, water, and\nenergy.  This is still the right motivation, but over the last year or\nso I’ve been rethinking my decision to not eat meat.</p>\n\n<p>My concern was that I’d stopped paying attention to my food choices\nand a poorly considered vegetarian diet can easily yield a bad\nenvironmental outcome.  In particular, modern agriculture now takes\n<a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2008/10/12/magazine/12policy-t.html?_r=2&pagewanted=all\">10 calories of fossil fuel energy to produce a single calorie of\nfood</a>.  This is clearly unsustainable.  We cannot rely on\nnon-renewable, polluting resources for our food, nor can we continue\nto transport food great distances – even if it is only vegetables.\nMy unexamined commitment to a vegetarian diet was no longer consistent\nwith environmental sustainability.</p>\n\n<p>I think the solution is to eat local, organic food.  This also\nrequires eating seasonal food, but Canadian winters are horrible for\nlocal vegetables.  This left me wanting to support local agriculture,\nbut unable to restrict my diet.  Returning to my original motivation\nto choose environmentally appropriate food convinced me it was time to\nreturn to being an omnivore. My new policy is to follow Michael\nPollan’s advice: “Eat food. Mostly plants. Not too much.”  In\naddition, I’ll favour locally grown, organic food and include small\namounts of meat – which I hope will predominantly come from carefully\nconsidered and sustainable sources.  I’ve also deciced that when faced\nwith a dillema of choosing either local or organic, I’ll choose local.\nWe need to support local agriculture and I’ll trade this for organic\nif necessary.  Of course, in the majority of cases local and organic\noptions are available, and I’ll choose them.</p>\n\n<p>This is a big change and I look forward to exploring food again.</p>\n",

The good news is that the twinned crises in food and energy are creating a political environment in which real reform of the food system may actually be possible for the first time in a generation.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The core of his solution is:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>&hellip; we need to wean the American food system off its heavy 20th-century diet of fossil fuel and put it back on a diet of contemporary sunshine</p>\n</blockquote>\n",

				"content_text": "<p>Like most Canadians, I’ll be at the polls today for the 2008 Federal Election.</p>\n\n<p>In the past several elections, I’ve cast my vote for the party with the best climate change plan.  The <a href=\"http://econ-environment.ca/\" title=\"An Open Letter to the Leaders of Canada’s Federal Political Parties\">consensus among economists</a> is that any credible plan must set a price on carbon emissions. My personal preference is for a predictable and transparent price to influence consumer spending, so I favour a carbon tax over a cap-and-trade. Enlightening discussions of these issues are available at <a href=\"http://worthwhile.typepad.com/worthwhile_canadian_initi/environment/\" title=\"Worthwhile Canadian Initiative: Environment\">Worthwhile Canadian Initiative</a>, <a href=\"http://www.theglobeandmail.com/opinions/columnists/Jeffrey+Simpson.html\" title=\"globeandmail.com: Opinions - Jeffrey Simpson\">Jeffrey Simpson’s column</a> at the Globe and Mail, or his book <a href=\"http://www.amazon.ca/gp/product/0771080972?ie=UTF8&tag=matthewroutle-20&linkCode=as2&camp=15121&creative=330641&creativeASIN=0771080972\">Hot Air</a><img src=\"http://www.assoc-amazon.ca/e/ir?t=matthewroutle-20&l=as2&o=15&a=0771080972\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" border=\"0\" alt=\"\" style=\"border:none !important; margin:0px !important;\"/>.</p>\n\n<p>Until now this voting principle has meant a vote for the <a href=\"http://www.greenparty.ca/\">Green Party</a> who support a tax shift from income to pollution. My expectation for this vote was not that the Green Party would gain any direct political power, rather their environmental plan would gain political profile and convince the Liberals and Conservatives to improve their plans. A carbon tax is now a central component of this year’s <a href=\"http://www.liberal.ca/platform_e.aspx\" title=\"Liberal.ca :: Richer, Fairer, Greener : An Action Plan for the 21st Century\">Liberal Platform</a> with the <a href=\"http://www.thegreenshift.ca/default_e.aspx\" title=\"thegreenshift.ca\">Green Shift</a>. Both the <a href=\"http://www.conservative.ca/EN/4739/78192\">Conservative Pary</a> and <a href=\"http://www.ndp.ca/platform/environment/\" title=\"A Plan for the Environment That Will Really Work | NDP\">NDP</a> support a limited cap-and-trade system on portions of the economy, with the Conservatives supporting dubious “intensity-based” targets.</p>\n\n<p>Although I quite like the central components of the Green Shift, I’m not too keen on the distracting social engineering aspects of the plan. Furthermore, the Liberals have certainly failed to implement any of their previous climate change plans while in power. Nonetheless, I do think (hope?) they will follow through this time and I prefer supporting a well-conceived plan that may not be implemented than a poor plan. Despite my support for this plan, I think the Liberals have done a rather poor job of explaining the Green Shift and have conducted a disappointing campaign.</p>\n\n<p>In the end, my principle will hold. I’m voting for the Green Shift and, reluctantly, the Liberal Party of Canada.</p>\n",

Paul Nelson offers up an <a href=\"http://www.pnas.org/cgi/content/abstract/104/7/2043\">article</a> by Doolittle and Bapteste as proof that Darwinism is unravelling. I suspect he hopes no one will read past the abstract to discover the reasonable debate scientists are having about the universality of a single tree of life. He certainly doesn’t want you to notice that the entire article is couched within evolutionary theory and not once does it claim that Darwinism has been falsified.</p>\n\n<p>Here’s the hypothesis that Doolittle and Bapteste are evaluating:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>“that there should be a universal TOL [tree of life], dichotomously branching all of the way down to a single root.” p2045</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>They then establish that gene transfer often occurs between lineages, particularly among prokaryotes, and consequently this universal tree of life does not exist. Certainly this complicates the construction of molecular trees and shows the importance for pluralism of mechanism in biology. But they write much more about the overall significance of this work.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>“To be sure, much of evolution has been tree-like and is captured in hierarchical classifications.” p2048</p>\n  \n  <p>“…it would be perverse to claim that Darwin’s TOL hypothesis has been falsified for animals (the taxon to which he primarily addressed himself) or that it is not an appropriate model for many taxa at many levels of analysis” p2048</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>And the crucial quote in this context:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>“Holding onto this ladder of pattern […] should not be an essential element in our struggle against those who doubt the validity of evolutionary theory, who can take comfort from this challenge to the TOL only by a willful misunderstanding of its import.” p2048</p>\n</blockquote>\n",

				"content_text": "<p>Note – This post has been updated from 2007-03-20 to describe new installation instructions.</p>\n\n<h3>Overview</h3>\n\n<p>I’ve integrated <a href=\"http://www.stikkit.com/\">Stikkit</a> into most of my workflow and am quite happy with the results. However, one missing piece is quick access to Stikkit from the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command_line_interface\">command line</a>. In particular, a quick list of my undone todos is quite useful without having to load up a web browser.\nTo this end, I’ve written a <a href=\"http://www.ruby-lang.org/\">Ruby</a> script for interacting with Stikkit. As I mentioned, my real interest is in listing undone todos. But I decided to make the script more general, so you can ask for specific types of stikkits and restrict the stikkits with specific parameters. Also, since the <a href=\"http://www.stikkit.com/api\">stikkit api</a> is so easy to use, I added in a method for creating new stikkits.</p>\n\n<h3>Usage</h3>\n\n<p>The general use of the script is to list stikkits of a particular type, filtered by a parameter. For example,</p>\n\n<pre><code>ruby stikkit.rb --list calendar dates=today</code></pre>\n\n<p>will show all of today’s calendar events. While,</p>\n\n<pre><code>ruby stikkit.rb -l todos done=0</code></pre>\n\n<p>lists all undone todos. The use of -l instead of <code>--list</code> is simply a standard convenience. Furthermore, since this last example comprises almost all of my use for this script, I added a convenience method to get all undone todos</p>\n\n<pre><code>ruby stikkit.rb -t</code></pre>\n\n<p>A good way to understand stikkit types and parameters is to keep an eye on the url while you interact with Stikkit in your browser.\nTo create a new stikkit, use the <code>--create</code> flag,</p>\n\n<pre><code>ruby stikkit.rb -c 'Remember me.'</code></pre>\n\n<p>The text you pass to stikkit.rb will be processed as usual by Stikkit.</p>\n\n<h3>Installation</h3>\n\n<p>Grab the script from the <a href=\"http://code.google.com/p/stikkit-rb/\">Google Code project</a> and put it somewhere convenient. Making the file executable and adding it to your path will cut down on the typing. The script reads from a .stikkit file in your path that contains your username and password. Modify this template and save it as ~/.sikkit</p>\n\n<pre><code>\n     ---\n     username: me@domain.org \n     password: superSecret \n</code></pre>\n\n<p>The script also requires the <a href=\"http://split-s.blogspot.com/2006/04/atom-10-parser-for-ruby.html\">atom gem</a>, which you can grab with</p>\n\n<pre><code>gem install atom</code></pre>\n\n<p>I’ve tried to include some flexibility in the processing of stikkits. So, if you don’t like using <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atom\">atom</a>, you can switch to a different <a href=\"http://stikkit.com/api#responses\">format</a> provided by Stikkit. The text type requires no gems, but makes picking out pieces of the stikkits challenging.</p>\n\n<h3>Feedback</h3>\n\n<p>This script serves me well, but I’m interested in making it more useful. Feel free to pass along any comments or feature requests.</p>\n",

Without providing too much detail, pipes are a way to filter, connect, and generally mash-up the web with a straightforward interface. I’ve used this service to collect all of the Globe and Mail feeds of interest, filter out the duplicates, and produce a feed I can subscribe to. Nothing fancy, but quite useful. <a href=\"http://pipes.yahoo.com/pipes/pipe.info?_id=YjZyKsHM2xGr3_z5l7okhQ\">The pipe</a> is publicly available and if you don’t agree with my choice of news feeds, you are free to clone mine and create your own.

				"content_text": "<p>My experiences helping people manage their data has repeatedly shown that databases are poorly understood. This is well illustrated by the rampant abuses of spreadsheets for recording, manipulating, and analysing data.</p>\n\n<p>Most people realise that they should be using a database, the real issue is the difficulty of creating a proper database. This is a legitimate challenge. Typically, you need to carefully consider all of the categories of data and their relationships when creating the database, which makes the upfront costs quite significant. Why not just start throwing data into a spreadsheet and worry about it later?</p>\n\n<p>I think that <a href=\"http://dabbledb.com/\">DabbleDB</a> can solve this problem. A great strength of Dabble –- and the source of its name — is that you can start with a simple spreadsheet of data and progressively convert it to a database as you begin to better understand the data and your requirements.</p>\n\n<p>Dabble also has a host of great features for working with data. I’ll illustrate this with a database I created recently when we were looking for a new home. This is a daunting challenge. We looked at dozens of houses each with unique pros and cons in different neighbourhoods and with different price ranges. I certainly couldn’t keep track of them all.</p>\n\n<p>I started with a simple list of addresses for consideration. This was easily imported into Dabble and immediately became useful. Dabble can export to <a href=\"http://earth.google.com/\">Google Earth</a>, so I could quickly have an overview of the properties and their proximity to amenities like transit stops and parks. Next, I added in a field for asking price and MLS url which were also exported to Google Earth. Including price gave a good sense of how costs varied with location, while the url meant I could quickly view the entire listing for a property.</p>\n\n<p>Next, we started scheduling appointments to view properties. Adding this to Dabble immediately created a calendar view. Better yet, Dabble can export this view as an <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ICalendar\">iCal</a> file to add into a calendaring program.</p>\n\n<p>Once we started viewing homes, we began to understand what we really were looking for in terms of features. So, add these to Dabble and then start grouping, searching, and sorting by these attributes.</p>\n\n<p>All of this would have been incredibly challenging without Dabble. No doubt, I would have simply used a spreadsheet and missed out on the rich functionality of a database.</p>\n\n<p>Dabble really is worth a look. The best way to start is to watch the <a href=\"http://dabbledb.com/explore/7minutedemo/\">seven minute demo</a> and then review some of the great <a href=\"http://dabbledb.com/explore/screencasts/\">screencasts</a>.</p>\n",

				"content_text": "<p>I like to believe that my brain is useful for analysis, synthesis, and creativity. Clearly it is not proficient at storing details like specific dates and looming reminders. Nonetheless, a great deal of my mental energy is devoted to trying to remember such details and fearing the consequences of the inevitable “it slipped my mind”. As counselled by <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GTD\">GTD</a>, I need a good and trustworthy system for removing these important, but distracting, details and having them reappear when needed. I’ve finally settled in on the new product from <a href=\"http://www.valuesofn.com/\">values of n</a> called <a href=\"http://stikkit.com/\">Stikkit</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Stikkit appeals to me for two main reasons: easy data entry and smart text processing. Stikkit uses the metaphor of the yellow sticky note for capturing text. When you create a new note, you are presented with a simple text field — nothing more. However, Stikkit parses your note for some key words and extracts information to make the note more useful. For example, if you type:</p>\n\n<pre><code>Phone call with John Smith on Feb 1 at 1pm\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Stikkit realises that you are describing an event scheduled for February 1st at one in the afternoon with a person (“peep” in Stikkit slang) named John Smith. A separate note will be created to track information about John Smith and will be linked to the phone call note. If you add the text “remind me” to the note, Stikkit will send you an email and SMS message prior to the event. You can also include tags to group notes together with the keywords “tag as”.</p>\n\n<p>A recent update to peeps makes them even more useful. Stikkit now collects information about people as you create notes. So, for example, if I later post:</p>\n\n<pre><code>- Send documents to John Smith john@smith.net\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Stikkit will recognise John Smith and update my peep for him with the email address provided. In this way, Stikkit becomes more useful as you continue to add information to notes. Also, the prefixed “-” causes Stikkit to recognise this note as a todo. I can then list all of my todos and check them off as they are completed.</p>\n\n<p>This text processing greatly simplifies data entry, since I don’t need to click around to create todos are choose dates from a calendar picker. Just type in the text, hit save, and I’m done. Fortunately, Stikkit has been designed to be smart rather than clever. The distinction here is that Stikkit relies on some key words (such as at, for, to) to mark up notes consistently and reliably. Clever software is exemplified by Microsoft Word’s autocorrect or clipboard assistant. My first goal when encountering these “features” is to turn them off. I find they rarely do the right thing and end up being a hindrance. <a href=\"http://stikkit.com/\">Stikkit</a> is well worth a look. For a great overview check out the <a href=\"http://community.valuesofn.com/stikkit/index.php?board=15.0\">screencasts</a> in the forum.</p>\n",

The job would have been quite challenging otherwise, and I think this represents a useful demonstration of why I choose to use Unix.</p>\n\n<p>The basic structure of the datafile was:</p>\n\n<pre><code>; A general header file ;\n1\nsample: 0.183 0.874 0.226 0.214 0.921 0.272 0.117\n2\nsample: 0.411 0.186 0.956 0.492 0.150 0.278 0.110\n3\n...\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>In this case the only important information is the second number of each line that begins with “sample:”. Of course, one option is to manually process the file, but there are thousands of lines, and that’s just silly.</p>\n\n<p>We begin by extracting only the lines that begin with “sample:”. <code>grep</code> will do this job easily:</p>\n\n<pre><code>grep \"^sample\" input.txt\n</code></pre>\n\n<p><code>grep</code> searches through the input.txt file and outputs any matching lines to standard output.</p>\n\n<p>Now, we need the second number. <code>sed</code> can strip out the initial text of each line with a find and replace while <code>tr</code> compresses any strange use of whitespace:</p>\n\n<pre><code>sed 's/sample: //g' | tr -s ' '\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Notice the use of the pipe (<code>|</code>) command here. This sends the output of one command to the input of the next.

Here are the principles I employ when making the decision:</p>\n\n<ul><li>Simple: This seems obvious, but many companies fail here. Typically, their downfall is focussing on a perpetual increase in feature quantity. I don’t evaluate software with feature counts. Rather, I value software that performs a few key operations well. Small, focussed tools result in much greater productivity than overly-complex, all-in-one tools. 37 Signals’ <a href=\"http://www.writeboard.com/\">Writeboard</a> is a great example of a simple, focussed tool for collaborative writing.</li><li><p>Open formats: I will not choose software that uses proprietary or closed data formats. Closed formats cause two main difficulties:</p></li><li><p>I must pay the proprietor of a closed format for the privilege of accessing my data. Furthermore, switching to a new set of software may require translating my data or, even worse, losing access altogether. Open formats allow me to access my data at any time and with any appropriate tool.</p></li><li><p>My tools are limited to the range of innovations that the proprietor deems important. Open formats allow me to take advantage of any great new tools that come available.</p></li><li><p>Flexible: As my requirements ebb and flow, I shouldn’t be locked into the constraints of a particular tool. The best options are internet-based, subscription plans. If I need more storage space or more access for collaborators, I simply choose a new subscription plan. Then, if things slow down, I can move back down to a basic plan and save money. The online backup service<a href=\"http://www.joyent.com/connector/Secure-Backups/\"> Strongpace</a>, for example, has a subscription plan tied to the amount of storage and number of users required.</p></li><li>Network: A good tool must be fully integrated into the network. The ability to collaborate with anyone or access my data from any computer are great boons to productivity. Many of the best tools are completely internet based; all that is required to use them is a web browser. This also means that the tool is monitored and maintained by a collection of experts and that the tool can be upgraded at any time without being locked into a version-number update. Furthermore, with data maintained on a network, many storage and backup problems are addressed. <a href=\"http://gmail.google.com/\">GMail</a>, for example, stores over 2GB of email, free of charge with an innovative user interface.</li></ul><p><em>Exemplars</em></p>\n\n<p>These are some of my favourite adherents to the principles outlined above:</p>\n\n<ul><li><a href=\"http://www.37signals.com/\">37 Signals</a></li><li><a href=\"http://gmail.google.com/\">GMail</a></li><li><a href=\"http://strongspace.com/\">Strongspace</a></li><li><a href=\"http://fluxiom.com/\">Fluxiom</a></li><li><a href=\"http://dabbledb.com/\">Dabble DB</a></li></ul>\n",

				"content_text": "<p>I generally write my documents in <a href=\"http://www.maths.lth.se/help/R/.R/library/utils/html/Sweave.html\">Sweave</a> format. This approach allows me to embed the code for analyses directly in the report derived from the analyses, so that all results and figures are generated dynamically with the text of the report. This provides both great documentation of the analyses and the convenience of a single file to keep track of and work with.</p>\n\n<p>Now there is a new contender for integrating analysis code and documentation with the release of an R module for <a href=\"http://wiki.contextgarden.net/Main_Page\">ConTeXt</a>. I prefer the clean implementation and modern features of ConTeXt to the excellent, but aging, <a href=\"http://www.latex-project.org/\">LaTeX</a> macro package that Sweave relies on. So, using ConTeXt for my documents is a great improvement.</p>\n\n<p>Here’s a simple example of using this new module. I create two randomly distributed, normal variables, test for a correlation between them, and plot their distribution.</p>\n\n<pre><code>\\usemodule[r]\n\n\\starttext\nDescribe the motivation of the analyses first.\n\nNow create some variables.\n\n\\startRhidden\nx <- rnorm(1000, 0, 1)\ny <- rnorm(1000, 0, 1)\n\\stopRhidden\n\nAre they correlated?\n\n\\startR\nmodel <- lm(y ~ x, data = test)\nsummary(model)\n\\stopR\n\nNow we can include a figure.\n\n\\startR\npdf(\"testFigure.pdf\")\nplot(x, y)\ndev.off()\n\\stopR\n\n\\startbuffer\n\\placefigure{Here it is}{\\externalfigure[testFigure]}\n\\stopbuffer\n\\getbuffer\n\n\\stoptext\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Processing this code produces a pdf file with all of the results produced from R, including the figure.</p>\n\n<p>I had some minor difficulties getting this to work on my OS X machine, through no fault of the r module itself. There are two problems. The first is that, by default, write18 is not enabled, so ConTeXt can’t access R directly. Fix this by editing <code>/usr/local/teTeX/texmf.cnf</code> so that “shell_escape = t”. The next is that the R module calls @texmfstart@ which isn’t directly accessible from a stock installation of TeX. The steps required are described in the “Configuration of texmfstart” section of the <a href=\"http://wiki.contextgarden.net/Mac_Installation\">ConTeXt wiki</a>. I modified this slightly by placing the script in <code>~/bin</code> so that I didn’t interfere with the installed teTeX tree. Now everything should work.</p>\n",

Some highlights include:</p>\n\n<p><em>Effect sizes</em> Some of the best cited studies for the use of drugs to treat heart disease show a statistically significant effect of only a few percentage points improvement. Contrast this with a dramatic, vastly superior improvement from diet alone.</p>\n\n<p><em>Response variables</em> The focus of many drug studies has been on the reduction of cholesterol, rather than reductions in heart disease. Diet studies, for example, have shown dramatic improvements in reducing heart attacks while having no effect on cholesterol levels. Conversely, drug studies that show a reduction in cholesterol show no change in mortality rates.</p>\n\n<p><em>Blocking of data</em> Separate analyses of drug efficacy on female or elderly patients tend to show that drug therapy increases overall mortality. Lumping these data in with the traditional middle-aged male patients removes this effect and, instead, shows a significant decrease in heart disease with drug use.</p>\n\n<p>The point here isn’t to make a comment on the influence of drug companies on medical research. Rather, such statistical concerns are common to all research disciplines. The primary concern of such analyses should be: what is the magnitude of the effect of a specific treatment on my variable of interest? The studies discussed in the Ideas program suggest that much effort has been devoted to detecting significant effects of drugs on surrogate response variables regardless of the size of the effect.</p>\n",

				"content_text": "<p>When response variables are composed of counts, the standard statistical methods that rely on the normal distribution are no longer applicable. Count data are comprised of positive integers and, often, many zeros. For such data, we need statistics based on Poisson or binomial distributions. I’ve spent the past few weeks analysing counts from hundreds of transects and, as is typical, a particular challenge was determining the appropriate packages to use for <a href=\"http://wwww.r-project.org/\">R</a>. Here’s what I’ve found so far.</p>\n<p>The first step is to get an idea of the dispersion of data points:</p>\n<pre class=\"r\"><code>Means <- tapply(y, list(x1, x2), mean)\nVars <- tapply(y, list(x1, x2), var)\nplot(Means, Vars, xlab=\"Means\", ylab=\"Variances\")\nabline(a=0, b=1)</code></pre>\n<p>For the Poisson distribution, the mean is equal to the variance. So, we expect the points to lie along the solid line added to the plot. If the points are overdispersed, a negative binomial link function may be more appropriate. The <code>pscl</code> library provides a function to test this:</p>\n<pre class=\"r\"><code>library(pscl)\nmodel.nb <- glm.nb(y ~ x, data=data)\nodTest(model.nb)\nsummary(model.nb)</code></pre>\n<p>If the <code>odTest</code> function rejects the null model, then the data are overdispersed relative to a Poisson distribution. One particularly useful function is <code>glmmPQL</code> from the <code>MASS</code> library. This function allows for random intercepts and combined with the negative.binomial function of the same library, you can fit a negative binomial GLMM:</p>\n<pre class=\"r\"><code>model.glmm.nb <- glmmPQL(y ~ x1 + x2,\n                         random= ~ 1|transect, data=data,\n                         family=negative.binomial(model.nb$theta))</code></pre>\n<p>In this case, I use the Θ estimated from the <code>glm.nb</code> function in the <code>negative.binomial</code> call. Also useful are the <code>zeroinfl</code> function of the <code>pscl</code> library for fitting zero-inflated Poisson or negative binomial models and the <code>geeglm</code> function of <code>geepack</code> for fitting generalized estimating equations for repeated measures. Finally, <code>fitdistr</code> from <code>MASS</code> allows for estimating the parameters of different distributions from empirical data.</p>\n",

The idea is to create workspaces associated with specific tasks as a virtual desktop. You can then switch between these desktops as you move from one project to the next. So, for each of the projects I am currently working on, I’ve created a desktop with each application’s windows in the appropriate place. For a consulting project, I likely have <a href=\"http://aquamacs.org/\">Aquamacs</a> running an R simulation with a terminal window open for updating my subversion repository. A project in the writing stage requires <a href=\"http://www.uoregon.edu/~koch/texshop/\">TeXShop</a> and <a href=\"http://bibdesk.sourceforge.net/\">BibDesk</a>, while a web-design project needs <a href=\"http://macromates.com/\">TextMate</a> and <a href=\"http://www.caminobrowser.org/\">Camino</a>. Each of these workspaces is independent and I can quickly switch to them when needed. Since the applications are running with their windows in the appropriate place, I can quickly get back to work on the project at hand.</p>\n\n<p>Application windows can be split across desktops and specific windows can be present across all desktops. I’ve also found it useful to have one desktop for communication (email, messaging, etc.) and another that has no windows open at all.</p>\n",

				"content_text": "<p>As I accumulate projects (both new and completed), the maintenance and storage of the project files becomes increasingly important. There are two important goals for a file structure: find things quickly and don’t lose anything. My current strategy is as follows:</p>\n\n<p>Every project has a consistent folder structure:</p>\n\n<pre><code>|-- analysis\n|-- data\n|-- db\n|-- doc\n|-- fig\n`-- utils\n</code></pre>\n\n<p><em>analysis</em> holds the <a href=\"http://www.r-project.org\">R</a> source files of the analysis. These, typically, are experiments and snippets of code. The main analyses are in the doc directory.</p>\n\n<p><em>data</em> contains data files. Generally, these are csv files from clients.</p>\n\n<p><em>db</em> is for sql dumps of databases and <a href=\"http://www.sqlite.org/\">sqlite</a> files. I prefer working with databases over flat text files or Excel spreadsheets. These files are kept in the data folder and converted to sql databases for analyses.</p>\n\n<p><em>doc</em> holds the analysis and writeup as a <a href=\"http://www.ci.tuwien.ac.at/~leisch/Sweave/FAQ.html\">Sweave</a> file. This combines R and <a href=\"http://www.latex-project.org/\">LaTeX</a> to create a complete document from one source file.</p>\n\n<p><em>fig</em> is for diagrams and plots. Many of these are generated when processing the Sweave file, but some are constructed from other sources.</p>\n\n<p><em>utils</em> holds scripts and binaries that are required to run the analysis.</p>\n\n<p>This entire directory structure is maintained with <a href=\"http://subversion.tigris.org/\">Subversion</a>, so I have a record of changes and can access the project files from any networked computer.</p>\n\n<p>Finally, once a project is complete, I archive the project and construct a sha <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Checksum\">checksum</a> of the zip file.</p>\n\n<p><code>openssl dgst -sha1 -out checksums.txt archive.zip</code></p>\n\n<p>This checksum allows me to verify that the archive remains stable over time. Coupled with a good backup routine, this should keep the project files safe.</p>\n\n<p>This may seem elaborate, but data and their analyses are too important to be left scattered around a laptop’s hard drive.</p>\n\n<p>One other approach I’ve considered is using the R package structure to maintain projects. <a href=\"http://www.maths.bris.ac.uk/~maman/computerstuff/Rhelp/Rpackages.html\">This</a> is a useful guide, but the process seems too involved for my purposes.</p>\n",

We tested this hypothesis using Chamerion angustifolium (Onagraceae), in which pollen removal (male)   and pollen deposition (female) were measured directly on hermaphroditic and experimentally produced unisexual flowers. During a single flower visit in the field, bees deposited 159±24 (SE) pollen grains on a stigma and removed 1058±198 grains from each flower. Anther removal did not alter deposition   rates. In the laboratory, bees removed 2669±273 pollen grains and deposited 209±72.3 cross-pollen and 120±28.4 facilitated self-pollen grains per visit. The presence of anthers significantly reduced cross-pollen deposition on the stigma. In contrast, pollen removal was not affected by presence of the pistil.

We examined the relation between outcrossing and population size in eastern Ontario populations of Aquilegia canadensis. Experimental pollinations showed that the species is highly self-compatible, and can achieve full seed-set in the absence of pollinators via automatic self-pollination. We estimated levels of outcrossing (t) and parental inbreeding coefficients (F) from allozyme variation in naturally pollinated seed families for 10 populations ranging in size from 32 to 750 reproductive individuals. The proportion of seeds produced through outcrossing was generally low (mean = 0.29 +/- 0.02 SE) and varied widely among populations (range = 0.00-0.83). Accordingly, estimates of F were large (mean = 0.26 +/- 0.05) and significantly greater than zero in seven populations. As expected, four small populations (N < 40) outcrossed less (0.17 +/- 0.03) than six large populations (N > 90; 0.38 +/- 0. 03). However, parental plants were not significantly more inbred in small than large populations (P = 0.18). There was no difference in the germination of seeds from hand self- and cross-pollinations. However, population genetic estimates of inbreeding depression for survival expressed from seed to reproductive maturity were very high (mean delta = 1 - relative fitness of selfed seed = 0.88 +/- 0.14). The combination of self-compatibility and automatic self-pollination makes the mating system of A. canadensis sensitive to variation in ecological factors that affect the likelihood of cross-pollination.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.hubmed.org/display.cgi?issn=0018067X&uids=0010383672\">Citation</a> ~ <a href=\"/files/PopulationSizeT.pdf\">Download</a></p>\n",

				"content_text": "<p>Protandry, a form of temporal separation of gender within hermaphroditic flowers, may reduce the magnitude of pollen lost to selfing (pollen discounting) and also serve to enhance pollen export and outcross siring success. Because pollen discounting is strongest when selfing occurs between flowers on the same plant, the advantage of protandry may be greatest in plants with large floral displays. We tested this hypothesis with enclosed, artificial populations of Chamerion angustifolium (Onagraceae) by experimentally manipulating protandry (producing uniformly adichogamous or mixed protandrous and adichogamous populations) and inflorescence size (two-, six-, or 10-flowered inflorescences) and measuring pollinator visitation, seed set, female outcrossing rate, and outcross siring success. Bees spent more time foraging on and visited more flowers of larger inflorescences than small. Female outcrossing rates did not vary among inflorescence size treatments. However, seed set per fruit decreased with increasing inflorescence size, likely as a result of increased abortion of selfed embryos, perhaps obscuring the magnitude of geitonogamous selfing. Protandrous plants had a marginally higher female outcrossing rate than adichogamous plants, but similar seed set. More importantly, protandrous plants had, on average, a twofold siring advantage relative to adichogamous plants. However, this siring advantage did not increase linearly with inflorescence size, suggesting that protandry acts to enhance siring success, but not exclusively by reducing between-flower interference.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.hubmed.org/display.cgi?issn=00143820&uids=12683521\">Citation</a> ~ <a href=\"http://public.me.com/mroutley\">Download</a> ProtandryDiscounting.pdf</p>\n",

However, a comparative survey found that many dichogamous species are self-incompatible (SI), suggesting dichogamy evolved for other reasons, particularly reducing interference between male and female function. Here we re-examined the association between dichogamy and SI in a phylogenetic framework, and tested the hypothesis that dichogamy evolved to reduce interference between male and female function.  Using paired comparisons and maximum-likelihood correlation analyses, we find that protandry (male function first) is positively correlated with the presence of SI and protogyny (female function first) with self-compatibility (SC). In addition, estimates of transition-rate parameters suggest strong selection for the evolution of SC in protogynous taxa and a constraint against transitions from protandry to protogyny in SC taxa. We interpret these results as support for protandry evolving to reduce interference and protogyny to reduce inbreeding.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.journals.uchicago.edu/IJPS/journal/issues/v165n6/165091/brief/165091.abstract.html\">Citation</a> ~ <a href=\"http://public.me.com/mroutley/SIandDichogamy.pdf\">SIandDichogamy.pdf</a></p>\n",

However, paternal and maternal reproductive success may not increase because within-clone pollination (geitonogamy) can reduce pollen export to adjacent clones (pollen discounting) and pollen import to the central ramets (pollen limitation). We investigated the relationship between clone size and mating success using clones of Malus x domestica at four orchards (blocks of 1–5 rows of trees). For each block, we measured maternal function as fruit and seed set in all rows and paternal function as siring rate in the first row of the adjacent block. Expected relations between reproductive success and clone size were generated from simulations and data on pollen dispersal in this species. Siring rate per clone averaged 70\\% and did not increase significantly with block size, consistent with simulations of pollen dispersal under pollen discounting. Simulations also indicated that the ratio of compatible to incompatible pollen received by a tree should decline with increased block size and from the periphery to the centre of blocks. However, no significant reductions in female function were detected among block sizes or within blocks. Our results suggest that paternal function may be more sensitive to the effects of clonality than female function.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.amjbot.org/cgi/content/abstract/91/9/1326\">Citation</a> ~ <a href=\"http://public.me.com/mroutley\">Download</a> AppleCloneSize.pdf</p>\n",

We examined these potential constraints in protandrous Chamerion angustifolium (Onagraceae) by estimating genetic variation in male-phase duration and associated floral traits using a paternal half-sib design and selection experiment. Narrow-sense heritability of male-phase duration was estimated as 0.23 (SE +- 0.04) and was positively correlated with floral display. The selection experiment shortened male-phase duration 0.8 SD from the parental average of 17.0 h and lengthened it by 2.0 SD. Furthermore, fixed floral longevity caused a negative association between male- and female-phase durations. These results suggest that selection on male-phase duration is not limited by genetic variation. However, changes in male-phase duration may influence pollinators through correlated changes in floral display and reduced opportunities for pollen receipt during female phase.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.hubmed.org/display.cgi?issn=1010061X&uids=16033578\">Citation</a> ~ <a href=\"http://public.me.com/mroutley\">Download</a> protandryHeritability.pdf</p>\n",

				"content_text": "<p>Mating by outcrossing plants depends on the frequency and quality of interaction between pollen vectors and individual flowers. However, the historical focus of pollination biology on individual flowers (floricentrism) cannot produce a complete understanding of the role of pollination in plant mating, because mating is an aggregate process, which depends on the reproductive outcomes of all of a plant’s flowers. Simultaneous display of multiple flowers in an inflorescence increases a plant’s attractiveness to pollinators, which should generally enhance mating opportunities. However, whenever pollinators visit multiple flowers on an inflorescence, self-pollination among flowers can reduce the pollen available for export to other plants (pollen discounting) and increase the incidence of inbreeding depression for embryos and offspring. Therefore, the size of floral displays that maximizes mating frequency and quality generally balances the benefits of attractiveness against the costs of self-pollination. This balance can shift considerably if different flowers serve female and male functions at one time (sexual segregation) and flowers are arranged in inflorescences so that pollinators visit female flowers before male flowers. However, the effectiveness of sexual segregation depends on the extent to which a particular inflorescence architecture induces consistent movement patterns by pollinators. In general, the consistency of pollinator movement patterns varies with inflorescence architecture and differs between pollinator types. Such variation creates many options for the evolution of the diverse inflorescence characteristics within angiosperms, which can be appreciated only by moving beyond a floricentric perspective of the role of pollination in plant mating.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/bsc/psb/2004/00000019/00000003/art00002\">Citation</a>\n<a href=\"http://public.me.com/mroutley/Floricentrism.pdf\">Download</a></p>\n",

				"content_text": "<p>Pollen and ovules experience diverse fates during pollination, pollen-tube growth, fertilization, and seed development, which govern the male and female potential of flowering plants.  This chapter identifies these fates and many of their interactions, and considers their theoretical implications for the evolution of pollen export and the production of selfed and outcrossed seeds.  This analysis clarifies the importance of pollen quantity and quality for seed production, including the opportunity for poor pollen quality to cause misidentification of pollen limitation.  Our analysis emphasizes the asymmetry of pollen and ovule fates and considers its consequences for reproductive evolution.  We also identify ovule limitation as a constraint on seed production, which has paradoxically not been recognized before, but is an implicit assumption of previous theoretical analysis of mating-system evolution.  Ovule limitation increases the diversity of possible reproductive policies.  In addition to ovule limitation, we consider the implications of pollen and resource limitation for the evolution of self- and cross-fertilization.  Resource limitation occurs only if plants produce more ovules than they can mature into seeds, which allows a mixture of selfing and outcrossing to be an optimal mating system in some circumstances.  The chance of mixed mating being optimal is eroded by trade-offs between self- and cross-pollination, but they do not alter the optimal combination of selfing and outcrossing, should mixed mating be favoured.  Our analysis illustrates the key role played by interactions between genetic and ecological influences on reproductive performance in the evolution of plant reproduction.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.botany.utoronto.ca/E_E%20of%20Flowers/\">Citation</a></p>\n",

				"content_text": "<p>I recently lost control of my email. The combination of mailing lists, alerts, table of content notifications, and actual email from friends and colleagues was reaching a few hundred emails a day. The insanity had to stop! Here’s how I regained control.</p>\n\n<h2>Goals</h2>\n\n<p>Before describing my solution, let’s consider what a good email system should provide?</p>\n\n<ul><li>Notifications of relevant new messages.</li>\n<li>A process for keeping track of important and unanswered messages.</li>\n<li>Automatic archiving with excellent search capabilities.</li>\n<li>Portability and easy access.</li>\n</ul><h2>Strategy</h2>\n\n<p>I implemented my strategy as I switched to a <a href=\"http://mail.google.com\">Gmail</a> account, which required that I catalogue and cancel all of my email subscriptions. Rather than re-subscribing to these, I redirected as many as possible to <a href=\"http://ranchero.com/netnewswire\">NetNewsWire</a>. Many journals now provide feeds for their table of content alerts (e.g., <a href=\"http://www.nature.com/nature/newsfeeds.html\">Nature</a>) and most of the important newsgroups are available through <a href=\"http://www.gmane.com/\">Gmane</a>. The advantage of news feeds over email alerts is that I can easily group the alerts and choose when to refresh the subscriptions. Typically, I refresh my feed subscriptions in the morning as I caffeinate. I can simply flag important threads or articles for followup later if necessary and my Inbox is no longer cluttered.</p>\n\n<p>Switching to Gmail also immediately solved several other issues with email. First, I no longer worry about storing and archiving email. All of it stays on Google’s servers. Second, this also solves the problem of deciding which messages to keep. Previously, for every new message I had to decide whether to delete it forever or store a copy. Although this only takes a few seconds for each message, when you receive hundreds of messages this can add up. Now, I don’t worry about it. I know that with the combination of Gmail’s search capabilities and my Mac’s <a href=\"http://www.apple.com/macosx/features/spotlight/\">Spotlight</a> technology, I can find messages almost instantly. Third, Gmail is available from any webbrowser – now, so is my email.</p>\n\n<p>That’s great so far, but I still have a variety of unfiltered email and I want to only be alerted to important or relevant messages. This is where <a href=\"http://www.apple.com/macosx/features/mail/\">Mail.app’s</a> smart mailboxes and rules become important. The most important rule is that a message from someone who is not in my <a href=\"http://www.apple.com/macosx/features/addressbook/\">Address Book</a> is immediately redirected out of my Inbox. I’ve also implemented a variety of <a href=\"http://mail.google.com/support/bin/answer.py?answer=12096&topic=1565\">aliases</a> that allows easy filtering of email from my Inbox. All of these filtered messages are gathered together in a folder which I, generally, peruse once a day.</p>\n\n<p>Now I’m left with an Inbox containing only messages from people that I know. As new mail arrives, any mail that survives my filters is sent to <a href=\"http://growl.info/\">Growl</a> and an unobtrusive notification apprises me of the sender and subject. I can then choose to ignore the message if I’m busy or switch to Mail and read the message if it appears to be important.</p>\n\n<p>As I process my messages, I implement the <a href=\"http://www.amazon.ca/exec/obidos/redirect?link_code=ur2&tag=matthewroutle-20&camp=15121&creative=330641&path=ASIN%2F0142000280%2Fqid%3D1133552449%2Fsr%3D8-1%2Fref%3Dsr_8_xs_ap_i1_xgl\">GTD</a> workflow: if responding takes less than two minutes, I respond; otherwise, the message is flagged for follow-up. Finally, I have two smart mailboxes: flagged messages; and messages received today. Since I’ve asked Mail to group messages by thread, today’s messages also pull in all of my previous correspondence on the subject. Messages in these two mailboxes are what appear in my main message window. When I switch to Mail all I see are flagged, and therefore important, messages and current conversations.</p>\n\n<p>This all may seem elaborate, but I find it works well.</p>\n",

While clonal growth can increase the number of flowers a plant produces it may also limit reproductive success through pollen discounting (reduction in pollen exported to adjacent clones) and pollen limitation (failure of outside pollen to reach the centre of a clone). Using clones of domestic apple (Malus x domestica) that ranged from 1 to 5 orchard rows wide, we found that the patterns of siring success were consistent with the presence of pollen discounting, but we failed to detect evidence for pollen limitation.

				"content_text": "<p>Dichogamy, the temporal separation of gender within a flower, is widespread throughout the angiosperms, occurring in over 250 families. There are two forms of dichogamy: protandry, in which male function precedes female function, and protogyny, the converse. Dichogamy has traditionally been interpreted as a mechanism to avoid inbreeding. However, recent evidence indicates that this inbreeding-avoidance hypothesis cannot completely explain the evolution of dichogamy. An alternate hypothesis is that dichogamy acts to reduce interference between gender functions. Interference can occur within a flower or between flowers on an inflorescence and result in substantial reductions in male and female reproductive success. To date there are very few tests of this interference-avoidance hypothesis or, in fact, investigations of the evolution of dichogamy in general. My Ph.D. thesis was a comprehensive evaluation of the evolutionary significance of dichogamy, including functional, genetic, comparative, and theoretical analyses of this important floral character.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://matt.routleynet.org/uploads/2019/02908cc8b7.jpg\" width=\"250\" height=\"331\" alt=\"clint\"/></p>\n\n<p>This Claytonia species is protandrous. The flower on the left is in male phase with its anthers shedding pollen and the stigma closed and unreceptive. The flower on the right is approximately one day older and is in female phase. The stigma is open and receptive and the anthers have moved away to the side and are empty of pollen.</p>\n\n<h2>Functional analyses</h2>\n\n<p>As an evaluation of the fitness consequences of protandry, we tested the interference-avoidance hypothesis with enclosed, artificial populations of Chamerion angustifolium (Onagraceae) by experimentally manipulating protandry and inflorescence size and measuring pollinator visitation, seed set, female outcrossing-rate, and outcross siring-success. Protandrous plants had a marginally higher female outcrossing rate than adichogamous plants, but similar seed set and visitation rates. More importantly, protandrous plants (blue points) had, on average, a twofold siring advantage relative to adichogamous plants (red points). However, this siring advantage did not increase linearly with inflorescence size, suggesting that protandry acts to enhance siring success, but not exclusively by reducing between-flower interference.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://matt.routleynet.org/uploads/2019/885b748f18.jpg\" width=\"500\" height=\"458\" alt=\"siring\"/></p>\n\n<p>To better understand the function of protandry, we analyzed single bee visits to pairs of C. angustifolium flowers in the field and the lab. The patterns of pollen removal and deposition revealed two major consequences of simultaneous hermaphroditism. First, the presence of anthers impeded pollinator’s access to the stigma. Second, pollinators spent more time foraging on hermaphroditic flowers, relative to female flowers. Protandry allows pollen to be exported in the absence of this within-flower interference and can enhance both male and female reproductive success through reductions in pollen discounting and facilitated selfing, respectively.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://matt.routleynet.org/uploads/2019/eb7545a393.jpg\" width=\"400\" height=\"299\" alt=\"beevisit\"/></p>\n\n<h2>Genetic analysis</h2>\n\n<p>The genetic basis of dichogamy may have important implications for its evolution. Consequently, we conducted genetic analyses of protandry in C. angustifolium using a paternal half-sib design and an artificial selection experiment. We found moderate heritability (h^2^=0.27) for the duration of male phase. An analysis of plants from the artificial selection experiment showed no genetic correlation between male-phase duration and aspects of floral size. However, we estimated a positive genetic correlation between male-phase duration and floral display size. In addition, we detected a negative correlation between male- and female-phase durations which creates the opportunity for fitness trade-offs between male and female function.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://matt.routleynet.org/uploads/2019/65f28c4282.jpg\" width=\"464\" height=\"442\" alt=\"sel\"/></p>\n\n<h2>Phylogenetic analysis</h2>\n\n<p>To gain a broader perspective on the evolution of dichogamy, we used a current, well resolved phylogeny of the angiosperms to conduct a comparative analysis of dichogamy and self-incompatibility. Using paired-comparisons and maximum-likelihood correlation analyses, we found that protandry is positively correlated with self-incompatibility and protogyny with self-compatibility. These results support a role for interference avoidance in the evolution of protandry and inbreeding avoidance in the evolution of protogyny, suggesting that the two forms of dichogamy provide different functions. In addition, dichogamy changes character states throughout the phylogeny, allowing rapid responses to changing ecological circumstance.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://matt.routleynet.org/uploads/2019/3de9902b7b.jpg\" width=\"500\" height=\"375\" alt=\"phylo\"/></p>\n\n<h2>Theoretical analysis</h2>\n\n<p>We developed a conceptual model to synthesize the effects of male-phase duration, inflorescence size, and inbreeding depression on pollen import and export. The relative fitness of protandry is strongly affected by the combination of floral display size and inbreeding depression. Furthermore, the trade-off between male- and female-phase durations produced a fitness landscape much more favourable to the evolution of protandry.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://matt.routleynet.org/uploads/2019/1eafaacb9c.jpg\" width=\"451\" height=\"366\" alt=\"relfitness\"/></p>\n\n<h2>Conclusions</h2>\n\n<p>Collectively, this research suggest that protandry enhances male fitness through reductions in both within- and between-flower interference, while protogyny reduces inbreeding. This work has revealed unexpected fitness benefits to protandry and helps to explain the wide taxonomic and ecological distribution of this trait in flowering plants.</p>\n\n<h2>Collaborator(s):</h2>\n\n<ul><li><a href=\"http://www.uoguelph.ca/botany/research/evollab/\">Brian Husband</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.holycross.edu/departments/biology/website/biofaculty/rbertin.html\">Robert Bertin</a></li>\n</ul><h2>Publication(s):</h2>\n\n<ul><li>Routley M.B. & Husband B.C., 2005, Does sexual segregation reduce within-flower interference?

				"content_text": "<p>As I use <a href=\"http://www.r-project.org/\">R</a> for data analysis and simulations, I become more comfortable and proficient with the R/S syntax and style of programming. One important insight is the use of vector assignments in simulations. I have often read that using such assignments is the preferred method, but until recently I had not realised the importance of this statement. To illustrate the use of vector assignments and their advantages, consider two models of the style illustrated below:</p>\n\n<p>Model 1:</p>\n\n<pre><code> value1List <- seq(1:10)\n value2Function <- function (value1) {\n     ifelse(value1 < constant1, constant2, constant1)\n }\n tableDimension <- length(value1List)\n outputTable <- NULL\n outputTable <- data.frame(value1=numeric(tableDimension), \n value2=numeric(tableDimension))\n n <- 1\n for (value1 in value1List) {\n     outputTable[n, ] <- c(value1, value2Function(value1))\n     n <- n + 1\n }\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Model 2:</p>\n\n<pre><code> value1List <- seq(1:10)\n tableDimension <- length(value1List)\n outputTable <- NULL\n outputTable$value1 <- rep(value1List, each=\n     tableDimension / (length(value1List)))\n outputTable <- as.data.frame(outputTable)\n outputTable$value2 <- ifelse(value1 < constant1, constant2, constant1)\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Model 1 is how I originally approached R programming. It begins with declaration of a sequence for value1 and a function declaration to calculate value2 from each value1. I then declare a table to capture the output and fill it with zero values. The main loop of the program consists of replacing the rows of the output table with each value of value1 and the calculated value2. I use the variable n to keep track of the next row in the table. The function rbind() could also be used to generate the table, but it’s use for large datasets is quite inefficient.</p>\n\n<p>Model 2 takes the approach of constructing each column of the output table in sequence. It begins by repeating the values of the value1List and then creates the value2 column through a vector assignment. No control structures or function calls are required in Model 2.</p>\n\n<p>How is this important? Model 1 seems intuitive (at least to me) while the syntax of Model 2 is opaque at first glance. However, consider this figure:\n<img src=\"https://matt.routleynet.org/uploads/2019/de6dc42431.png\" width=\"377\" height=\"365\" alt=\"vectorR\"/></p>\n\n<p>On the x-axis is the number of data points in the output table on a log scale. The y-axis shows how long the model takes to calculate these values. Model 1 is the blue line. Model 2 is the red line. This illustrates two important points:\n * Model 1 is always slower than Model 2.\n * As the size of the dataset increases, Model 2 remains fast while Model 1 rapidly consumes all of the computer resources.</p>\n\n<p>This is why vector assignments should be used when programming with R. Just to be clear, the models described here are simple abstractions of the types of models used to generate this figure.</p>\n",

The first step is to calculate your emissions and then implement recommendations for reductions. According to the online calculator, Kelly & I combined emit 4.23 tonnes annually. Fortunately, this is below the national average of 5.5 tonnes per person and significantly better than Alberta’s average of 8 tonnes per person. Still, we could do better. However, the suggestions provided aren’t much help. They largely concern implementing energy savings to our home — which we rent and have little control over. Here are the suggestions I could implement:</p>\n\n<ul><li>Take a 5-minute shower instead of a bath.</li>\n    <li>Turn off lights when a room is not in use.</li>\n    <li>Use a cold water wash and rinse instead of warm or hot water to wash your clothes.</li>\n    <li>Replace standard light bulbs with compact fluorescent light bulbs where lights are on for three or more hours at a time.</li>\n</ul><p>The <a href=\"http://www.climatechange.gc.ca/onetonne/english/index.asp\">website</a> has a variety of good suggestions.

				"content_text": "<p>Plants are sessile and, consequently, many species rely on pollinators for mating opportunities. However, pollinators do not necessarily visit every individual in a population with equal frequency. Plant attributes, such as floral display and reward provisioning, can influence the frequency of pollinator visitation. Furthermore, aspects of population density and structure may also influence visitation patterns. One effect of this unequal distribution of pollinator activity is that pollinators create networks of connections between plants in which a few plant receive many visits and many plants receive few visits. Such networks are termed ‘scale-free’ and can be contrasted with random networks. Random networks follow a Poisson distribution of connection frequency and have the familiar bell shape characteristic of many biological patterns. Scale-free networks have power-law distributions with no peak, just a steady decline in the frequency of nodes with increasing number of connections. Technically, in a scale-free network the probability that any node is connected to k other nodes is proportional to 1/k^n^, where n is usually around 2.</p>\n\n<h3>Measuring networks</h3>\n\n<p>The hallmark of a scale-free network is a hub or node with a high number of connections. A relatively simple test for hubs is to plot a histogram of the number of connections between plants. This is illustrated in the following figures. On the left, many plants have a low frequency of connections, while a few plants have many connections. Those plants with many connections could be hubs. Contrast this with the right. The distribution of connections follows a bell shape with no plants having an excessive number of connections. There are no hub plants in this population.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://matt.routleynet.org/uploads/2019/fdae864422.jpg\" alt=\"Example network\"/></p>\n\n<h3>Importance of scale-free networks</h3>\n\n<p>The analysis of scale-free networks has provided insights into fields as diverse as scientific-citation patterns, disease epidemics, world-wide-web structure, and cellular metabolism. Such power suggests that applying network thinking to pollination biology may be useful. These networks are produced through a process of growth and unequal creation of connections. Clearly plant populations experience changes in population size and pollinator behaviour often leads to 'traplining’ or enhanced visitation to particular phenotypes. Consequently, plant populations have some of the prerequisites for scale-free networks. Scale-free networks are very resilient to the random loss of nodes, because the vast majority of network function is provided by the hubs. In a plant population context, if a population can be characterised by a power-law distribution, population growth rates and persistence are likely driven by a small subset of the plants. Such an asymmetry would have important implications for evolutionary ecology and conservation questions.</p>\n\n<p>An important first step is to determine if pollinator-visitation patterns follow a power-law distribution. Hub plants could then be identified and the mechanisms producing the pattern investigated. Are hubs spatially clustered? Do they have larger-than-average floral displays or brighter floral pigments? What are the demographic consequences of removing hubs from a plant population? All we need is data on pollinator visits to plant populations. The data I have access to are inconclusive, mostly because they have insufficient visit frequencies. Any other data sets would be appreciated.</p>\n\n<p>For more information on networks visit <a href=\"http://www.nd.edu/~networks\" title=\"Networks\">www.nd.edu/~networks</a>.</p>\n",

Traditionally, ecological data is analysed from the binary perspective of hypothesis testing. The goal of such testing is to either accept or reject a null hypothesis. Although it is well entrenched in ecological training and publication, this hypothesis testing has repeatedly been attacked by <a href=\"http://links.jstor.org/sici?sici=0035-9254%281996%2945%3A4%3C401%3AAASC%3E2.0.CO%3B2-0\">statisticians</a> and many <a href=\"http://www.npwrc.usgs.gov/resource/1999/statsig/statsig.htm\">ecologists</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Without entering into this debate now, Hilborn and Mangel present an alternative of constructing models of the biological system of interest and then testing the model with collected data.

One approach is to use a simple majority rule. For example, if more than half of the species possess character state x rather than y, then the family can be described as x. However, this approach seemed rather liberal, which led to a 2/3 majority criterion: if more than 2/3 of the species are x, the family is x; If less than 1/3 is x the family is y; otherwise the family is ambiguous.</p>\n\n<p>A significant drawback to arbitrarily creating such criteria is that I had no idea what the consequences were for making Type I and Type II errors. Presumably, as the criterion becomes more stringent, Type I errors are less likely, but such uncertainty is not comforting. I decided a better approach would be to attempt a simulation study using different criteria coupled with a more sophisticated character state reconstruction algorithm.</p>\n\n<p>The general approach was to create a family of twenty species and randomly assign a fixed proportion of each species one of two possible character states. The fixed probability chosen represented the decision criteria to be evaluated. For example, a 51% proportion is equivalent to the simple majority criterion. I then randomly generated 5,000 phylogenetic tree topologies for the family. To evaluate any given decision criterion, I compared the family characterization from the decision criterion to the ancestral-state reconstruction from <a href=\"http://links.jstor.org/sici?sici=0014-3820%28199712%2951%3A6%3C1699%3ALOASIA%3E2.0.CO%3B2-4\">Schluter et al’s</a> maximum-likelihood analysis. The idea is that the maximum-likelihood reconstruction should be reasonably accurate, since it incorporates tree topology into its calculations. If the decision criterion and maximum-likelihood approaches yield similar answers, the decision criterion may be a good choice for describing families in the absence of species-level phylogenetic resolution.</p>\n\n<p>I tested three decision criteria. Their results are: an 80% criterion was 98.1% accurate, 65% was 91.6%, and 55% was 60.8%. Clearly more stringent criteria are most similar to the more sophisticated maximum-likelihood analyses. However, stringency does exclude more data from the analysis as more families become ambiguously coded. A proper trade-off between stringency and sample size is required to make the best use of data.</p>\n\n<p>I conducted these simulations with <a href=\"http://www.mesquiteproject.org\">Mesquite</a> and the data file is available(<a href=\"http://public.me.com/mroutley/simulations.nex\">http://public.me.com/mroutley/simulations.nex</a>).</p>\n",

				"content_text": "<p>Unrelated to my “official” thesis work, I have been thinking about floral form and its influence on plant fitness. As an excuse to start a discussion with anyone interested, I’ve posted this overview of what I hope to work on next.</p>\n\n<p>Plant mating systems control the transmission of genes between generations and, therefore, are a fundamental characteristic of populations. Since flowers are the reproductive organs of plants, floral form fundamentally influences plant mating systems. However, research into floral evolution has traditionally “atomized” flowers into conspicuous traits that are then investigated independently. Despite the undeniable success of this reductionist approach, an alternate research strategy called phenotypic integration, found at the intersection of morphometrics, quantitative genetics, reproductive ecology, and plant evolution, offers a unique perspective. Floral integration, in particular, asserts that the variance-covariance structure of entire flowers, rather than mean values of individual traits, may be an important target for selection. This is especially relevant for animal-pollinated, hermaphroditic flowers (i.e., most angiosperms) in which the male and female sexual organs must be positioned precisely within the path of pollen movement. Consequently, I expect high integration for anther and stigma placement relative to, for example, vegetative characters. After a long period of neglect, floral integration is beginning to receive more attention. To date, most of this research has focussed on quantifying the magnitude of integration, whereas the evolutionary significance of variation in floral integration remains an open question.</p>\n",
