There were scheduled times for registration and all we needed was the receipt from our online payment.

There were two stickers for the bike, both of which had my bib number on them and matched the number on my wristband. Staff at the transition entrance used these to make sure the bike belonged to me, before letting me in. Then I tracked down my transition spot, which was nicely equidistant from the swim, bike, and run entrances.</p>\n<p>That was it for the Saturday events, other than eating some <a href=\"https://i-my-thai.business.site/\">tasty Thai food</a> and getting a good night&rsquo;s sleep. Sunday (race day) started early, so that I could set up my transition area by 6:30. I took about 10 minutes to get everything organized and visualize how I&rsquo;d move through the zone.</p>\n<h2 id=\"swim\">Swim</h2>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<p>We were organized into age groups for the swim start. As one of the older groups, we started 20 minutes after the first wave.

During this, I was able to wiggle out of the top half of my wetsuit, in preparation for the rest of the transition.

Plenty of practical and insightful advice in this book. \n\nPicking a favourite fiction book is always fraught. This year, I think it was [A Closed and Common Orbit](https://micro.blog/books/9781473621459) by Becky Chambers.

There were scheduled times for registration and all we needed was the QR code from our online payment. With that, they handed over a wristband, timing chip, all sorts of stickers with my bib number, swim cap, t-shirt, and a morning gear bag for transferring clothing from the swim start to the run finish.</p>\n<p>Next up was dropping my bike off at the transition.

The pro men started right at 7, followed by the pro women at 7:05, and then the rest of us started at 7:10.

This kept a steady stream of swimmers going through the start without a giant crowd. The only downside was that it took a while to clear the beach. The pro men had already started their bike rides before I&rsquo;d even left the beach! I crossed the start line at 7:32.</p>\n<p>Not much to say about the swim. The water was a nice, cool temperature and there were only a few spots around the half-way point where there was any significant contact with other swimmers. This was mostly because at that point we were swimming directly into the sun and seeing the buoys was really challenging. We all just kept swimming forward, assuming that anyone in front of us was headed in roughly the right direction and it all worked out.</p>\n<p>I saw at least three people getting hauled out of the water by the safety teams that were paddling around in canoes and kayaks. I can only imagine how difficult it would be to need to quit the race so early, but safety is so much more important than pushing through and risking serious injury.</p>\n<p>One challenge I had with the <a href=\"https://matt.routleynet.org/2022/06/05/a-big-thank.html\">Milton sprint triathlon</a> was significant dizziness at the end of the swim and, consequently, a challenge getting through T1 on the bike. So, this time I slowed down near the end of the swim and tried to more carefully move from vertical to horizontal while getting out of the water. This seemed to help; although I still felt a bit light-headed, it wasn&rsquo;t nearly as bad as last time.</p>\n<p>33 minutes for the swim was faster than I&rsquo;d planned, though I felt good throughout. So, I wasn&rsquo;t worried.</p>\n<p>The swim ended with a 200m run into the transition zone. During this, I was able to wiggle out of the top half of my wetsuit, in preparation for the rest of the transition. Once I was at my transition spot, I pulled off the wetsuit and quickly consumed one <a href=\"https://endurancetap.com/products/caffeinated-energy-gel-can\">caffeinated gel</a>. Then helmet on (they&rsquo;re really strict about not touching your bike without a helmet on), bike shoes on, and grabbed the bike to run out to the bike mount line.</p>\n<h2 id=\"bike\">Bike</h2>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<p>The bike course was gorgeous. Lots of hills through Canadian Shield and forests on (mostly) smooth asphalt. There was a really steep downhill around km 16 that got me up to about 79 km/h and, since this was part of a loop, I also had to climb back up this hill on the way back. I&rsquo;d been worried about this when looking at the map. But, in the end, it wasn&rsquo;t so bad. I knew it was coming and just had to power through. The part that surprised me was the undulating hills in the last third. Despite the great scenery, these were really hard!</p>\n<p>My coach had advised I keep my heart rate around 155 throughout the bike course. Other than a few of the climbs, I was able to stick to this. It was actually really helpful to have a specific target to keep trying to hit. Three hours on the bike can get rather tedious without something to focus on and there&rsquo;s always a worry about pushing too hard on the bike and blowing up on the run.</p>\n<p>There were four aid stations on the bike course. Given the heat warning, at each one I grabbed a 750mL bottle of water. 2/3rds of the water I sprayed onto my head for cooling, the rest I drank. They had kids at the end of each aid station with hockey nets and sticks. You threw the empty bottle towards the net and they stick handled them in for disposal.</p>\n<p>I also had a 750mL bottle of electrolytes and 500mL bottle of water on the bike that I consumed throughout, along with two <a href=\"https://endurancetap.com/products/stroopwafel?ref=yotpo_94\">Stroopwafels</a> and two <a href=\"https://endurancetap.com/products/classic-energy-gel-can?ref=yotpo_94\">energy gels</a>.</p>\n<p>2 hours and 56 minutes on the bike was a few minutes faster than I&rsquo;d anticipated. So, also happy with this. By the end of the 90km, my legs felt reasonably fresh, but I was glad to get off the bike. Things were starting to get pretty uncomfortable. This might partly have been because it was actually my first ever ride with aero bars. I wouldn&rsquo;t recommend waiting until a race to try these out, though that was how it worked out for me. Overall, I&rsquo;d say the aero bars were more comfortable than I&rsquo;d expected, I just wasn&rsquo;t used to them.</p>\n<h2 id=\"run\">Run</h2>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<p>T2 was straightforward. I racked my bike, took off my helmet, and switched to running shoes and a hat. One more caffeinated gel and off I went.</p>\n<p>My plan was to maintain a 5:30 minutes/km pace for the run with an emphasis on keeping it slow after the bike transition (it is really tempting to start running fast off the bike). This was sustainable for about the first half. By the second half, though, the heat really started catching up with me and I had to slow down to around 6 minutes/km. I was super sensitive about pushing too hard in the heat and, consequently, jeopardizing actually finishing the race. So, I wasn&rsquo;t upset about slowing down. I did see at least two people off to the side of the course being attended by medics with apparent heat stroke, which were good reminders to pace carefully.</p>\n<p>I&rsquo;d committed to myself before the race that I would walk through each of the 12 aid stations. At each one, one water went onto my head, another I drank, and then I grabbed a couple of cups of ice. I had a small ziplock bag that I put ice in to hold, while the other ice went down the front of the Triathlon suit. Like me, many of the runners were making lots of jiggling noises as the ice that had fallen down into our shorts bounced around. Absolutely necessary though, given the heat and humidity.</p>\n<p>For nutrition on the run, I had two gels: one at about the 10km mark and the other around 15 km.</p>\n<p>The run course was also gorgeous. We ran through a decommissioned rail road track converted to a multi-use recreational path through the heart of the Laurentians that included waterfalls and forested areas. Although not as shaded as I&rsquo;d hoped, the course was great. There were also a few spots with sprinklers or fire hydrants spraying water. These were helpful for cooling down. I was particularly amused by the local resident that was lounging in a lawn chair with a beer in one hand and hose in the other. A bit of eye contact and thumbs up was all you needed to have him hose you down on the way by: so refreshing!</p>\n<p>Kilometres 14 to 17 were pretty tough. I was far enough along to be pretty tired, but not yet quite far enough to know that it was almost over. Knowing my family was at the end, ready to cheer me on really helped here.</p>\n<p>The last km of the run was an extra experience. You run right down the hill through the middle of the Tremblant village with spectators cheering you on from either side. Despite all the hard work up to this point, you really feel pretty energized for this part, especially when you finally see the finish line up ahead.</p>\n<p>2 hours and 3 minutes for the run was just a few minutes slower than I&rsquo;d anticipated. I was totally happy with this time, given everything that preceded it and the heat.</p>\n<h2 id=\"post-race\">Post-race</h2>\n<p>The finish line funnels you into a big tent with picnic benches.

So, both he and I took a rapid test that confirmed we were infected. \n\nThursday night was peak symptoms for me, producing an abysmal RTT.\n\n<img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/6287/2022/677f552b15.png\" width=\"350\" height=\"\" alt=\"Apple Watch screenshot showing RTT very low and in red\" style=\"height: auto;\" class=\"sunlit_image\" />\n\nAll morning in bed on Friday helped a lot and then a much better sleep last night layered improvement on top. \n\nToday's RTT seems rather optimistic to me though. My planned intensity included a two hour bike ride and 20k run. Those are not happening! Today's planned intensity will be watching the season finale of Severance in my pyjamas. \n\n<img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/6287/2022/c7f8fffb3c.png\" width=\"350\" height=\"\" alt=\"Apple Watch screenshot showing RTT trending up and in green\" style=\"height: auto;\" class=\"sunlit_image\" />\n\nMy experience with RTT is that it typically reinforces how I actually feel with, perhaps, the occasional early warning. Basically a second opinion that reinforces my intuition. But when we disagree, like now, I'm definitely following how I feel. \n",

So, whatever I was doing, I picked the most closely related playlist.</p>\n<p>Often these were straightforward. Cooking dinner with help from the kids: <a href=\"https://music.apple.com/us/playlist/cooking-with-family/pl.5f59cffdd4644040bed2b7562d83f270\">Cooking with Family</a>; triaging the morning inbox of email: <a href=\"https://music.apple.com/us/playlist/checking-email/pl.f323a401141748cfb74e08ef2f98193f\">Checking Email</a>; mind mapping a project: <a href=\"https://music.apple.com/us/playlist/brainstorming/pl.acf4e6669fbd4baba50e249d57db5a61\">Brainstorming</a>.</p>\n<p>Other times it was more mood oriented. Reading by the fire when it is -20ºC: <a href=\"https://music.apple.com/us/playlist/winter/pl.8b36c21d1ce7493392a2f845c4293408\">Winter</a>; augmenting an early Wednesday morning coffee: <a href=\"https://music.apple.com/us/playlist/wake-me-up/pl.c79a0c8eac46444ea8058d68008ba2d4\">Wake Me Up!</a>.</p>\n<p>Overall, the playlists are good.</p>\n<p>The ones I listened to are meaningfully distinct from each other and the song choices do match the general mood of the activity. Just as one example, although their names are quite close, I did get different vibes from the <a href=\"https://music.apple.com/us/playlist/deep-focus/pl.556863bb540c4651b6196bf82e2a3bb9\">Deep Focus</a>, <a href=\"https://music.apple.com/us/playlist/peaceful-focus/pl.9b8a976ba78741d9925e6e9a050703de\">Peaceful Focus</a>, and <a href=\"https://music.apple.com/us/playlist/creative-focus/pl.4351e59aabd44f73a7b2a832020acc55\">Creative Focus</a> playlists.</p>\n<p>In general the song choices are, not surprisingly, oriented towards the pop genres. That said, they aren’t just a collection of current hits. Playlists include some old gems and more obscure songs. Clearly, the songs were chosen with care and not strictly driven by machine learning algorithms.</p>\n<p>One unanticipated side effect of this was that the rest of the family noted how much better the music was in the kitchen. No more of that “weird Dad music” 🙄. I take some consolation in the knowledge that in about ten years they’ll rediscover and appreciate these “classic songs” and finally realize that, in fact, I do have good musical tastes.</p>\n<p>Although the music is generally good, discoverability is terrible. MacStories <a href=\"https://www.macstories.net/stories/a-comprehensive-guide-to-250-of-apple-musics-new-mood-and-activity-playlists/\">pointed this out</a> and created a very helpful Shortcut for grouping and playing these playlists. Even when you select “See All” from the Just Ask Siri section, Apple Music shows some random selection of the playlists. I haven’t noticed any particular pattern of which ones are displayed and can’t understand why Apple is making it so difficult to browse them. Maybe they’re still experimenting?</p>\n<p>I never did find reasons to listen to many of the playlists, like the whole series for Zodiac signs or the one for <a href=\"https://music.apple.com/us/playlist/square-dancing/pl.81be3a937c8f416391f8c13ca38ae5f9\">square dancing</a>. This just shows the diversity of playlists available and, again, points out the problem with discoverability.</p>\n<p>This was a successful experiment that forced me to actually experience the feature. That said, I wouldn’t want to continue relying on only these playlists. I’ll keep using them when I can’t be bothered to carefully choose an album or playlist and just want something appropriate to the mood or activity, which surely is the whole point of them anyway.</p>\n",

Cooking dinner with help from the kids: [Cooking with Family](https://music.apple.com/us/playlist/cooking-with-family/pl.5f59cffdd4644040bed2b7562d83f270); triaging the morning inbox of email: [Checking Email](https://music.apple.com/us/playlist/checking-email/pl.f323a401141748cfb74e08ef2f98193f); mind mapping a project: [Brainstorming](https://music.apple.com/us/playlist/brainstorming/pl.acf4e6669fbd4baba50e249d57db5a61). \n\nOther times it was more mood oriented. Reading by the fire when it is -20ºC: [Winter](https://music.apple.com/us/playlist/winter/pl.8b36c21d1ce7493392a2f845c4293408); augmenting an early Wednesday morning coffee: [Wake Me Up!](https://music.apple.com/us/playlist/wake-me-up/pl.c79a0c8eac46444ea8058d68008ba2d4).\n\nOverall, the playlists are good. \n\nThe ones I listened to are meaningfully distinct from each other and the song choices do match the general mood of the activity. Just as one example, although their names are quite close, I did get different vibes from the [Deep Focus](https://music.apple.com/us/playlist/deep-focus/pl.556863bb540c4651b6196bf82e2a3bb9), [Peaceful Focus](https://music.apple.com/us/playlist/peaceful-focus/pl.9b8a976ba78741d9925e6e9a050703de), and [Creative Focus](https://music.apple.com/us/playlist/creative-focus/pl.4351e59aabd44f73a7b2a832020acc55) playlists. \n\nIn general the song choices are, not surprisingly, oriented towards the pop genres. That said, they aren’t just a collection of current hits. Playlists include some old gems and more obscure songs. Clearly, the songs were chosen with care and not strictly driven by machine learning algorithms. \n\nOne unanticipated side effect of this was that the rest of the family noted how much better the music was in the kitchen. No more of that “weird Dad music” 🙄. I take some consolation in the knowledge that in about ten years they’ll rediscover and appreciate these “classic songs” and finally realize that, in fact, I do have good musical tastes.\n\nAlthough the music is generally good, discoverability is terrible. MacStories [pointed this out](https://www.macstories.net/stories/a-comprehensive-guide-to-250-of-apple-musics-new-mood-and-activity-playlists/) and created a very helpful Shortcut for grouping and playing these playlists. Even when you select “See All” from the Just Ask Siri section, Apple Music shows some random selection of the playlists. I haven’t noticed any particular pattern of which ones are displayed and can’t understand why Apple is making it so difficult to browse them. Maybe they’re still experimenting?\n\nI never did find reasons to listen to many of the playlists, like the whole series for Zodiac signs or the one for [square dancing](https://music.apple.com/us/playlist/square-dancing/pl.81be3a937c8f416391f8c13ca38ae5f9). This just shows the diversity of playlists available and, again, points out the problem with discoverability.\n\nThis was a successful experiment that forced me to actually experience the feature. That said, I wouldn’t want to continue relying on only these playlists. I’ll keep using them when I can’t be bothered to carefully choose an album or playlist and just want something appropriate to the mood or activity, which surely is the whole point of them anyway.\n\n\n",

				"title": "Lessons from using Apple Notes for three months",
				"content_html": "<p>Back in September, I <a href=\"https://matt.routleynet.org/2021/09/15/surprising-no-one.html\">committed to using Apple Notes for three months</a>. The goal was to focus on my use cases for writing, rather than fiddling with new apps continuously.</p>\n<p>Here’s what I’ve identified so far. Many of the approaches and features that I’m using in these use cases are readily available in other apps and often Notes is not the most efficient choice. Now that I’ve documented these use cases, I’d like to use them to assess alternative apps.</p>\n<h2 id=\"meeting-notes\">Meeting notes</h2>\n<p>Thanks to <a href=\"https://timeryapp.com/\">Timery</a>, I know that 60% of my working time is spent in meeting. So many meetings!</p>\n<p>For each one, I create a note to capture ideas, useful information, and tasks. I’ve automated this with a couple of Shortcuts. The one I use the most is “<a href=\"https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/ec04ef510bc14168bf0394fc083eceb5\">Start My Next Meeting</a>”. This presents me with a list of upcoming meetings. I choose from the list and it creates a meeting note, starts a Timery timer, and opens the link to start the video call (typically Teams). The meeting note has the name of the meeting as the title, adds tags for #meeting and the Timery project, adds the date and time of the meeting, a list of attendees, and any notes from the calendar event. From this structure, I can then add notes throughout the meeting and extract any tasks into Reminders later.</p>\n<p>I used <a href=\"https://matt.routleynet.org/2019/10/15/task-management-with.html\">Agenda</a> for these sorts of notes before, which was powerful.</p>\n<h2 id=\"daily-summaries\">Daily summaries</h2>\n<p>Occasionally, I find myself at the end of a week with no clear sense of what I actually accomplished. To help with this, for the past year I’ve been recording the top three things I’ve done in a day into <a href=\"http://dayoneapp.com/\">Day One</a> (the <a href=\"https://dayoneapp.com/blog/its-time-for-templates\">5 Minute PM template</a> has been great for this).</p>\n<p>To augment this, I’ve been using another Shortcut to create a <a href=\"https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/952ca340b26a4c689710b9855d4c0a23\">Daily Work Report</a>. This makes a note of the meetings I attended, tasks I completed, and tasks I created. These all get saved to a Daily Notes folder. I then use the day’s work report to pull out the highlights for Day One. There’s some redundancy here, though I find the process of choosing just three things for Day One is helpful.</p>\n<p>Overall, I think that Day One is a better app for this use case.</p>\n<h2 id=\"project-notes\">Project notes</h2>\n<p>For each of my projects, I create a project note that states the purpose or objective of the project, key stakeholders, and timelines. Then I accumulate relevant notes and documents while making progress on the project. Creating these are also done via a <a href=\"https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/25e882b266dd42c9a2b19933f3b7934a\" title=\"Shortcut\">simple Shortcut</a>. I’ve experimented with using checklists for tasks in these notes, but find it isn’t as effective as my approach with <a href=\"https://matt.routleynet.org/2019/10/15/task-management-with.html\">MindNode</a> and Reminders.</p>\n<p>Once I finish a project, the associated note gets cleaned up and moved to an Archive folder to keep it out of the way.</p>\n<h2 id=\"research\">Research</h2>\n<p>This is a rather broad category and, unlike the previous use cases, is for both work and personal notes. Much of this is capturing facts, quotes, and sources. If it is project specific, they go to the project note. Some are more generic and are kept as a standalone note. All of them get tags to help provide some structure. This is where Apple Notes ability to accept almost anything from the share sheet is powerful.</p>\n<p>The new <a href=\"https://www.macstories.net/stories/fast-capture-with-quick-note-for-ipad-and-mac-the-macstories-overview/\">Quick Notes feature</a> has been interesting for research. The ability to quickly highlight and then resurrect content on websites is great. I find actually working with the quick notes is pretty clumsy though. They have to stay in the Quick Notes folder and choosing which one to send content to can be tricky. I think there’s some great potential here and will keep experimenting.</p>\n<p>For any webpages that I want to archive, I use <a href=\"https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/7b50dcf65d0e4b08870eb5c3d4efb109\">another Shortcut</a> that creates a plain-text note of the webpage along with some metadata and then adds the link to <a href=\"https://www.pinboard.com/\">Pinboard</a>. This has been surprisingly useful for recipes, when all I really want are the ingredients and steps, rather than the long history of the recipe’s development.</p>\n<h2 id=\"other-nice-features\">Other nice features</h2>\n<p>In addition to these use cases, there are a few nice features of Apple Notes that are worth mentioning.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>As should be apparent from above, creating useful Shortcuts for Apple Notes is straightforward. In some sense, it is the Shortcuts that I’m finding really useful. Apple Notes is just the final destination for the content.</li>\n<li>I’ve set up widgets by focus mode so that the most recent notes are shown on my Home Screen in the right context. These are restricted to a particular folder and sorted by date modified.</li>\n<li>The formatting options are comprehensive, including table support.</li>\n<li>I think I like the feature where checking off tasks moves them to the bottom of the list. Most of the time, this is what I want.</li>\n<li>The iCloud web app is convenient for using notes on my Windows work PC. Unfortunately, I’ve found the syncing to be rather unreliable here, where notes just don’t show up in the web app sometimes.</li>\n<li>I don’t share notes as often as I expected. When I do, it works really well.</li>\n<li>Not really specific to Apple Notes, but I stole an idea from <a href=\"https://www.matthewcassinelli.com/shortcuts/note-taker/\">Matthew Cassinelli</a> to aggregate all of these Notes Shortcuts into one super Shortcut that creates a list of Shortcuts to choose from.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"challenges\">Challenges</h2>\n<p>There are a few things that don’t work as well as they should:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Searching is too limited. In particular, you can’t narrow searches to particular folders. Most of the time I either only want to search my meeting notes or not include them. I had to set up a <a href=\"https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/8583784c018b4d5c9df1947e24dfcd01\">Shortcut</a> that takes a search term as an input and then asks me to specify which folder to search. This should be built into the app’s search field.</li>\n<li>Linking among notes isn’t really supported. You can sort of do this with url searches for note titles.

				"content_text": "Back in September, I [committed to using Apple Notes for three months](https://matt.routleynet.org/2021/09/15/surprising-no-one.html). The goal was to focus on my use cases for writing, rather than fiddling with new apps continuously. \n\nHere’s what I’ve identified so far. Many of the approaches and features that I’m using in these use cases are readily available in other apps and often Notes is not the most efficient choice. Now that I’ve documented these use cases, I’d like to use them to assess alternative apps.\n\n## Meeting notes\nThanks to [Timery](https://timeryapp.com/), I know that 60% of my working time is spent in meeting. So many meetings! \n\nFor each one, I create a note to capture ideas, useful information, and tasks. I’ve automated this with a couple of Shortcuts. The one I use the most is “[Start My Next Meeting](https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/ec04ef510bc14168bf0394fc083eceb5)”. This presents me with a list of upcoming meetings. I choose from the list and it creates a meeting note, starts a Timery timer, and opens the link to start the video call (typically Teams). The meeting note has the name of the meeting as the title, adds tags for #meeting and the Timery project, adds the date and time of the meeting, a list of attendees, and any notes from the calendar event. From this structure, I can then add notes throughout the meeting and extract any tasks into Reminders later.\n\nI used [Agenda](https://matt.routleynet.org/2019/10/15/task-management-with.html) for these sorts of notes before, which was powerful.\n\n## Daily summaries\nOccasionally, I find myself at the end of a week with no clear sense of what I actually accomplished. To help with this, for the past year I’ve been recording the top three things I’ve done in a day into [Day One](http://dayoneapp.com/) (the [5 Minute PM template](https://dayoneapp.com/blog/its-time-for-templates) has been great for this).\n\nTo augment this, I’ve been using another Shortcut to create a [Daily Work Report](https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/952ca340b26a4c689710b9855d4c0a23). This makes a note of the meetings I attended, tasks I completed, and tasks I created. These all get saved to a Daily Notes folder. I then use the day’s work report to pull out the highlights for Day One. There’s some redundancy here, though I find the process of choosing just three things for Day One is helpful.\n\nOverall, I think that Day One is a better app for this use case.\n\n## Project notes\nFor each of my projects, I create a project note that states the purpose or objective of the project, key stakeholders, and timelines. Then I accumulate relevant notes and documents while making progress on the project. Creating these are also done via a [simple Shortcut](https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/25e882b266dd42c9a2b19933f3b7934a \"Shortcut\"). I’ve experimented with using checklists for tasks in these notes, but find it isn’t as effective as my approach with [MindNode](https://matt.routleynet.org/2019/10/15/task-management-with.html) and Reminders.\n\nOnce I finish a project, the associated note gets cleaned up and moved to an Archive folder to keep it out of the way.\n\n## Research\nThis is a rather broad category and, unlike the previous use cases, is for both work and personal notes. Much of this is capturing facts, quotes, and sources. If it is project specific, they go to the project note. Some are more generic and are kept as a standalone note. All of them get tags to help provide some structure. This is where Apple Notes ability to accept almost anything from the share sheet is powerful.\n\nThe new [Quick Notes feature](https://www.macstories.net/stories/fast-capture-with-quick-note-for-ipad-and-mac-the-macstories-overview/) has been interesting for research. The ability to quickly highlight and then resurrect content on websites is great. I find actually working with the quick notes is pretty clumsy though. They have to stay in the Quick Notes folder and choosing which one to send content to can be tricky. I think there’s some great potential here and will keep experimenting.\n\nFor any webpages that I want to archive, I use [another Shortcut](https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/7b50dcf65d0e4b08870eb5c3d4efb109) that creates a plain-text note of the webpage along with some metadata and then adds the link to [Pinboard](https://www.pinboard.com/). This has been surprisingly useful for recipes, when all I really want are the ingredients and steps, rather than the long history of the recipe’s development.\n\n## Other nice features\nIn addition to these use cases, there are a few nice features of Apple Notes that are worth mentioning.\n\n- As should be apparent from above, creating useful Shortcuts for Apple Notes is straightforward. In some sense, it is the Shortcuts that I’m finding really useful. Apple Notes is just the final destination for the content.\n- I’ve set up widgets by focus mode so that the most recent notes are shown on my Home Screen in the right context. These are restricted to a particular folder and sorted by date modified.\n- The formatting options are comprehensive, including table support.\n- I think I like the feature where checking off tasks moves them to the bottom of the list. Most of the time, this is what I want.\n- The iCloud web app is convenient for using notes on my Windows work PC. Unfortunately, I’ve found the syncing to be rather unreliable here, where notes just don’t show up in the web app sometimes.\n- I don’t share notes as often as I expected. When I do, it works really well.\n- Not really specific to Apple Notes, but I stole an idea from [Matthew Cassinelli](https://www.matthewcassinelli.com/shortcuts/note-taker/) to aggregate all of these Notes Shortcuts into one super Shortcut that creates a list of Shortcuts to choose from.\n\n## Challenges\nThere are a few things that don’t work as well as they should:\n\n- Searching is too limited. In particular, you can’t narrow searches to particular folders. Most of the time I either only want to search my meeting notes or not include them. I had to set up a [Shortcut](https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/8583784c018b4d5c9df1947e24dfcd01) that takes a search term as an input and then asks me to specify which folder to search. This should be built into the app’s search field.\n- Linking among notes isn’t really supported. You can sort of do this with url searches for note titles. Pretty clunky though.\n- Given how much I use Shortcuts for Apple Notes, it is frustrating how little you can do when creating a note. In particular, you can’t style text or add tags. Every time I use Shortcuts to create a note, the first thing I have to do is apply title and heading styles and convert any words prefixed with a # into an actual tag.\n\n## Other use cases\nI’ve found a few use cases that don’t yet fit in with Apple Notes. I’m using [Drafts](https://getdrafts.com/) for all of these:\n\n- Blog posts\n- Drafting long emails\n- Capturing and processing transitory texts, which Drafts is really optimized for\n\n---- \nRestricting myself to Apple Notes was a helpful trick for crystallizing my use cases. Now that I’m three months in, I think I’ll stick with Apple Notes for a while longer. I’ve built up a good ecosystem of Shortcuts for working with the app and, of course, now have lots of content in the app.\n\n",

				"content_text": "[Statistics Canada](https://www.statcan.gc.ca/eng/start) has a wealth of data that are essential for good public policy. Often a good third of my analytical scripts are devoted to accessing and processing data from the Statistics Canada website, which always seems like a waste of effort and good opportunity for making silly errors. So, I was keen to test out the [`cansim`package](https://mountainmath.github.io/cansim/index.html) for R to see how it might help. The quick answer is \"very much\".\n\nThe [documentation](https://mountainmath.github.io/cansim/articles/cansim.html) for the `cansim` package is thorough and doesn't need to be repeated here. I thought it might be useful to illustrate how helpful the package can be by refactoring [some earlier work](https://matt.routleynet.org/2020/01/10/things-cost-more.html) that explored consumer price inflation.\n\nThese scripts always start off with downloading and extracting the relevant data file:\n\n```R\ncpi_url <- \"https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/n1/tbl/csv/18100004-eng.zip\" # (1)\nif(file.exists(\"18100004-eng.zip\")) { # (2)\n    # Already downloaded\n  }  else {\n    download.file(cpi_url,\n      destfile = \"18100004-eng.zip\", \n      quiet = TRUE)\n    unzip(\"18100004-eng.zip\") # (3)\n  }\ncpi <- readr::read_csv(\"18100004.csv\") # (4)\n```\n A few things to note here:\n\n1. You need to know the url for the data. Sometimes the logic is clear and you can guess, but often that doesn't work and you need to spelunk through the Stats Can website\n2. To avoid downloading the file every time I run the script, there's a test to see if the file already exists\n3. This approach yields lots of files and folders that you need to manage, including making sure they're ignored by version control\n4. Using the great `readr` package imports the final csv file\n\nWith `cansim` all I need to know is the data series number:\n\n```R\ncansim_table <- \"18-10-0004\"\ncpi <- cansim::get_cansim(cansim_table)\n```\n\n`get_cansim`downloads the right file to a temporary directory, extracts the data, and imports it as a `tidyverse`-compatible data frame.\n\nThe `get_cansim` function has some other nice features. It automatically creates a `Date` column with the right type, inferred from the standard `REF_DATE` column. And, it also creates a `val_norm` column that intelligently converts the `VALUE` column. For example, converting percentage or thousand-dollar values into standard formats.\n\nThe `cansim` package is a great example of a really helpful utility package that allows me to focus on analysis, rather than fiddling around with data.

But, eventually success!\n\n<img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/6287/2021/895534abce.jpg\" width=\"600\" height=\"800\" alt=\"\" style=\"height: auto;\" class=\"sunlit_image\" />\n\nThen our last challenge, which I likely should have anticipated much sooner. We didn't bother ordering a DVD drive, since everything is online these days. But, our Windows installation showed up as a DVD and we couldn't create any Windows install media on our Apple devices. Fortunately, we checked in with a slightly older kid down the street and he provided us with a USB drive with the right software. With that challenge solved, we finished the project!\n\nNot counting choosing the components online, the whole project took about 5 hours from opening the boxes to booting into Windows for the first time. I'd definitely recommend it to anyone that's tempted and technically inclined. My son is quite excited to be using a computer that he built from parts.\n\n<a href=\"https://matt.routleynet.org/uploads/2021/245c9c10de.jpg\"><img src=\"https://micro.blog/photos/200/https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/6287/2021/245c9c10de.jpg\" width=\"600\" height=\"600\" alt=\"\" style=\"display: inline-block; max-height: 200px; width: auto; padding: 1px;\" class=\"sunlit_image\" /></a><a href=\"https://matt.routleynet.org/uploads/2021/d08697501d.jpg\"><img src=\"https://micro.blog/photos/200/https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/6287/2021/d08697501d.jpg\" width=\"600\" height=\"600\" alt=\"\" style=\"display: inline-block; max-height: 200px; width: auto; padding: 1px;\" class=\"sunlit_image\" /></a>\n",

I've also created a Shortcut that creates a new note in Agenda with all of my [completed tasks from Reminders](https://matt.routleynet.org/2019/10/15/task-management-with.html). This is a useful reminder of any non-meeting based things I've done (not everything is a meeting, yet).\n\nI'm finding this new routine to be a very helpful part of my daily shutdown routine: I often identify the most important thing to do tomorrow by reviewing what I did today. And starting tomorrow off with my top priority already identified really helps get the day going quickly.\n",

				"content_text": "<p>My <a href=\"https://www.torqride.com/\">favourite spin studio</a> has put on a fitness challenge for 2019. It has many components, one of which is improving your performance by 3% over six weeks. I’ve taken on the challenge and am now worried that I don’t know how reasonable this increase actually is. So, a perfect excuse to extract my metrics and perform some excessive analysis.</p>\n<p>We start by importing a CSV file of my stats, taken from Torq’s website. We use <code>readr</code> for this and set the <code>col_types</code> in advance to specify the type for each column, as well as skip some extra columns with <code>col_skip</code>. I find doing this at the same time as the import, rather than later in the process, more direct and efficient. I also like the flexibility of the <code>col_date</code> import, where I can convert the source data (e.g., “Mon 11/02/19 - 6:10 AM”) into a format <a href=\"https://xkcd.com/1179/\">more useful for analysis</a> (e.g., “2019-02-11”).</p>\n<p>One last bit of clean up is to specify the instructors that have led 5 or more sessions. Later, we’ll try to identify an instructor-effect on my performance and only 5 of the 10 instructors have sufficient data for such an analysis. The <code>forcats::fct_other</code> function is really handy for this: it collapses several factor levels together into one “Other” level.</p>\n<p>Lastly, I set the <code>challenge_start_date</code> variable for use later on.</p>\n<pre class=\"R\"><code>col_types = cols(\n  Date = col_date(format = \"%a %d/%m/%y - %H:%M %p\"),\n  Ride = col_skip(),\n  Instructor = col_character(),\n  Spot = col_skip(),\n  `Avg RPM` = col_skip(),\n  `Max RPM` = col_skip(),\n  `Avg Power` = col_double(),\n  `Max Power` = col_double(),\n  `Total Energy` = col_double(),\n  `Dist.

Given relatively high variability from class to class, we add a smoothed line to show the overall trend. We also mark the point where the challenge starts with a red line.</p>\n<pre class=\"r\"><code>ggplot2::ggplot(data, aes(x = Date, y = avg_power)) +\n  ggplot2::geom_point() +\n  ggplot2::geom_line() +\n  geom_smooth(method = \"loess\") +\n  ggplot2::ylab(\"Average power\") +\n  ggplot2::geom_vline(xintercept = challenge_start_date, col = \"red\")</code></pre>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/6287/2019/f229b3bab4.png\" width=\"672\" /></p>\n<p>Overall, looks like I made some steady progress when I started, plateaued in the Summer (when I didn’t ride as often), and then started a slow, steady increase in the Fall. Unfortunately for me, it also looks like I started to plateau in my improvement just in time for the challenge.</p>\n<p>We’ll start a more formal analysis by just testing to see what my average improvement is over time.</p>\n<pre class=\"r\"><code>time_model <- lm(avg_power ~ Date, data = data)\nsummary(time_model)</code></pre>\n<pre><code>## \n## Call:\n## lm(formula = avg_power ~ Date, data = data)\n## \n## Residuals:\n##     Min      1Q  Median      3Q     Max \n## -30.486 -11.356  -1.879  11.501  33.838 \n## \n## Coefficients:\n##               Estimate Std.

But, interpreting the coefficient for time isn’t entirely intuitive and isn’t really the point of the challenge. The question is: how much higher is my average power during the challenge than before? For that, we’ll set up a “dummy variable” based on the date of the class. Then we use <code>dplyr</code> to group by this variable and estimate the mean of the average power in both time periods.</p>\n<pre class=\"r\"><code>data %<>% \n  dplyr::mutate(in_challenge = ifelse(Date > challenge_start_date, 1, 0)) \n(change_in_power <- data %>% \n  dplyr::group_by(in_challenge) %>% \n  dplyr::summarize(mean_avg_power = mean(avg_power)))</code></pre>\n<pre><code>## # A tibble: 2 x 2\n##   in_challenge mean_avg_power\n##          <dbl>          <dbl>\n## 1            0           213.\n## 2            1           231.</code></pre>\n<p>So, I’ve improved from an average power of 213 to 231 for a improvement of 8%. A great relief: I’ve exceeded the target!</p>\n<p>Of course, having gone to all of this (excessive?) trouble, now I’m interested in seeing if the instructor leading the class has a significant impact on my results. I certainly feel as if some instructors are harder than others. But, is this supported by my actual results? As always, we start with a plot to get a visual sense of the data.</p>\n<pre class=\"r\"><code>ggplot2::ggplot(data, aes(x = Date, y = avg_power)) +\n  ggplot2::geom_point() +\n  ggplot2::geom_line() +\n  ggplot2::geom_smooth(method = \"lm\", se = FALSE) +\n  ggplot2::facet_wrap(~Instructor) +\n  ggplot2::ylab(\"Average power\")</code></pre>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/6287/2019/8e09c63772.png\" width=\"672\" /></p>\n<p>There’s a mix of confirmation and rejection of my expectations here:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Charlotte got me started and there’s a clear trend of increasing power as I figure out the bikes and gain fitness</li>\n<li>George’s class is always fun, but my progress isn’t as high as I’d like (indicated by the shallower slope). This is likely my fault though: George’s rides are almost always Friday morning and I’m often tired by then and don’t push myself as hard as I could</li>\n<li>Justine hasn’t led many of my classes, but my two best results are with her. That said, my last two rides with her haven’t been great</li>\n<li>Marawan’s classes always feel really tough. He’s great at motivation and I always feel like I’ve pushed really hard in his classes. You can sort of see this with the relatively higher position of the best fit line for his classes. But, I also had one really poor class with him. This seems to coincide with some poor classes with both Tanis and George though. So, I was likely a bit sick then. Also, for Marawan, I’m certain I’ve had more classes with him (each one is memorably challenging), as he’s substituted for other instructors several times. Looks like Torq’s tracker doesn’t adjust the name of the instructor to match this substitution though</li>\n<li>Tanis’ classes are usually tough too. She’s relentless about increasing resistance and looks like I was improving well with her</li>\n<li>Other isn’t really worth describing in any detail, as it is a mix of 5 other instructors each with different styles.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Having eye-balled the charts.

The story here is really that we need more data to tease out the impacts of the instructor by time effect.</p>\n<p>The last point to make is that we’ve focused so far on the average power, since that’s the metric for this fitness challenge.

In the meantime, looks like I’ll succeed with at least this component of the fitness challenge and I have the stats to prove it.</p>\n",

				"content_text": "<p>This is a “behind the scenes” elaboration of the geospatial analysis in our <a href=\"http://www.psephoanalytics.ca/2018/11/reviewing-our-2018-mayoral-race.html\">recent post</a> on evaluating our predictions for the 2018 mayoral election in Toronto. This was my first, serious use of the new <a href=\"https://r-spatial.github.io/sf/\"><code>sf</code> package</a> for geospatial analysis. I found the package much easier to use than some of my previous workflows for this sort of analysis, especially given its integration with the <a href=\"https://www.tidyverse.org/\">tidyverse</a>.</p>\n<p>We start by downloading the <a href=\"https://www.toronto.ca/city-government/data-research-maps/open-data/open-data-catalogue/#370e7072-0ba7-e477-121e-78ba5dac9649\">shapefile for voting locations</a> from the City of Toronto’s <a href=\"https://www.toronto.ca/city-government/data-research-maps/open-data/\">Open Data portal</a> and reading it with the <code>read_sf</code> function. Then, we pipe it to <code>st_transform</code> to set the appropriate <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Map_projection\">projection</a> for the data. In this case, this isn’t strictly necessary, since the shapefile is already in the right projection. But, I tend to do this for all shapefiles to avoid any oddities later.</p>\n\n```R\ndownload.file(\"http://opendata.toronto.ca/gcc/voting_location_2018_wgs84.zip\",\n                destfile = \"data-raw/voting_location_2018_wgs84.zip\", quiet = TRUE)\nunzip(\"data-raw/voting_location_2018_wgs84.zip\", exdir=\"data-raw/voting_location_2018_wgs84\")\ntoronto_locations <- sf::read_sf(\"data-raw/voting_location_2018_wgs84\", \n                                 layer = \"VOTING_LOCATION_2018_WGS84\") %>%\n  sf::st_transform(crs = \"+init=epsg:4326\")\ntoronto_locations\n```\n```R\n## Simple feature collection with 1700 features and 13 fields\n## geometry type:  POINT\n## dimension:      XY\n## bbox:           xmin: -79.61937 ymin: 43.59062 xmax: -79.12531 ymax: 43.83052\n## epsg (SRID):    4326\n## proj4string:    +proj=longlat +datum=WGS84 +no_defs\n## # A tibble: 1,700 x 14\n##    POINT_ID FEAT_CD FEAT_C_DSC PT_SHRT_CD PT_LNG_CD POINT_NAME VOTER_CNT\n##       <dbl> <chr>   <chr>      <chr>      <chr>     <chr>          <int>\n##  1    10190 P       Primary    056        10056     <NA>              37\n##  2    10064 P       Primary    060        10060     <NA>             532\n##  3    10999 S       Secondary  058        10058     Malibu           661\n##  4    11342 P       Primary    052        10052     <NA>            1914\n##  5    10640 P       Primary    047        10047     The Summit       956\n##  6    10487 S       Secondary  061        04061     White Eag…        51\n##  7    11004 P       Primary    063        04063     Holy Fami…      1510\n##  8    11357 P       Primary    024        11024     Rosedale …      1697\n##  9    12044 P       Primary    018        05018     Weston Pu…      1695\n## 10    11402 S       Secondary  066        04066     Elm Grove…        93\n## # ... with 1,690 more rows, and 7 more variables: OBJECTID <dbl>,\n## #   ADD_FULL <chr>, X <dbl>, Y <dbl>, LONGITUDE <dbl>, LATITUDE <dbl>,\n## #   geometry <POINT [°]>\n```\n\n<p>The file has 1700 rows of data across 14 columns.

The last column is a <a href=\"https://www.rstudio.com/resources/videos/how-to-work-with-list-columns/\">list column</a> that is added by <code>sf</code> and contains the geometry of the location. This specific design feature is what makes an <code>sf</code> object work really well with the rest of the tidyverse: the geographical details are just a column in the data frame. This makes the data much easier to work with than in other approaches, where the data is contained within an <code>[@data](https://micro.blog/data)</code> slot of an object.</p>\n<p>Plotting the data is straightforward, since <code>sf</code> objects have a <code>plot</code> function. Here’s an example where we plot the number of voters (<code>VOTER_CNT</code>) at each location. If you squint just right, you can see the general outline of Toronto in these points.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/6287/2019/c1f3d1400b.png\" width=\"672\" /></p>\n<p>What we want to do next is use the voting location data to aggregate the votes cast at each location into census tracts. This then allows us to associate census characteristics (like age and income) with the pattern of votes and develop our statistical relationships for predicting voter behaviour.</p>\n<p>We’ll split this into several steps. The first is downloading and reading the census tract shapefile.</p>\n\n```R\ndownload.file(\"http://www12.statcan.gc.ca/census-recensement/2011/geo/bound-limit/files-fichiers/gct_000b11a_e.zip\",\n                destfile = \"data-raw/gct_000b11a_e.zip\", quiet = TRUE)\nunzip(\"data-raw/gct_000b11a_e.zip\", exdir=\"data-raw/gct\")\ncensus_tracts <- sf::read_sf(\"data-raw/gct\", layer = \"gct_000b11a_e\") %>%\n  sf::st_transform(crs = \"+init=epsg:4326\")\n```\n\n<p>Now that we have it, all we really want are the census tracts in Toronto (the shapefile includes census tracts across Canada). We achieve this by intersecting the Toronto voting locations with the census tracts using standard R subsetting notation.</p>\n\n```R\nto_census_tracts <- census_tracts[toronto_locations,] \n```\n\n<p>And, we can plot it to see how well the intersection worked. This time we’ll plot the CTUID, which is the unique identifier for each census tract. This doesn’t mean anything in this context, but adds some nice colour to the plot.</p>\n\n```R \nplot(to_census_tracts[\"CTUID\"])\n```\n\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/6287/2019/22d42cb3c3.png\" width=\"672\" /></p>\n<p>Now you can really see the shape of Toronto, as well as the size of each census tract.</p>\n<p>Next we need to manipulate the voting data to get votes received by major candidates in the 2018 election. We take these data from the <a href=\"https://github.com/Psepho/toVotes\"><code>toVotes</code> package</a> and arbitrarily set the threshold for major candidates to receiving at least 100,000 votes. This yields our two main candidates: John Tory and Jennifer Keesmaat.</p>\n\n```R\nmajor_candidates <- toVotes %>% \n  dplyr::filter(year == 2018) %>%\n  dplyr::group_by(candidate) %>%\n  dplyr::summarise(votes = sum(votes)) %>%\n  dplyr::filter(votes > 100000) %>%\n  dplyr::select(candidate)\nmajor_candidates\n```\n\n```R\n## # A tibble: 2 x 1\n##   candidate        \n##   <chr>            \n## 1 Keesmaat Jennifer\n## 2 Tory John\n```\n\n<p>Given our goal of aggregating the votes received by each candidate into census tracts, we need a data frame that has each candidate in a separate column. We start by joining the major candidates table to the votes table. In this case, we also filter the votes to 2018, since John Tory has been a candidate in more than one election. Then we use the <code>tidyr</code> package to convert the table from long (with one candidate column) to wide (with a column for each candidate).</p>\n\n```R \nspread_votes <- toVotes %>%\n  tibble::as.tibble() %>% \n  dplyr::filter(year == 2018) %>%\n  dplyr::right_join(major_candidates) %>%\n  dplyr::select(-type, -year) %>%\n  tidyr::spread(candidate, votes)\nspread_votes \n```\n\n```R \n## # A tibble: 1,800 x 4\n##     ward  area `Keesmaat Jennifer` `Tory John`\n##    <int> <int>               <dbl>       <dbl>\n##  1     1     1                  66         301\n##  2     1     2                  72         376\n##  3     1     3                  40         255\n##  4     1     4                  24         161\n##  5     1     5                  51         211\n##  6     1     6                  74         372\n##  7     1     7                  70         378\n##  8     1     8                  10          77\n##  9     1     9                  11          82\n## 10     1    10                  12          76\n## # ... with 1,790 more rows\n```\n\n<p>Our last step before finally aggregating to census tracts is to join the <code>spread_votes</code> table with the <code>toronto_locations</code> data. This requires pulling the ward and area identifiers from the <code>PT_LNG_CD</code> column of the <code>toronto_locations</code> data frame which we do with some <code>stringr</code> functions. While we’re at it, we also update the candidate names to just surnames.</p>\n\n```R\nto_geo_votes <- toronto_locations %>%\n  dplyr::mutate(ward = as.integer(stringr::str_sub(PT_LNG_CD, 1, 2)),\n                area = as.integer(stringr::str_sub(PT_LNG_CD, -3, -1))) %>%\n  dplyr::left_join(spread_votes) %>%\n  dplyr::select(`Keesmaat Jennifer`, `Tory John`) %>%\n  dplyr::rename(Keesmaat = `Keesmaat Jennifer`, Tory = `Tory John`)\nto_geo_votes\n```\n\n```R\n## Simple feature collection with 1700 features and 2 fields\n## geometry type:  POINT\n## dimension:      XY\n## bbox:           xmin: -79.61937 ymin: 43.59062 xmax: -79.12531 ymax: 43.83052\n## epsg (SRID):    4326\n## proj4string:    +proj=longlat +datum=WGS84 +no_defs\n## # A tibble: 1,700 x 3\n##    Keesmaat  Tory             geometry\n##       <dbl> <dbl>          <POINT [°]>\n##  1       55   101 (-79.40225 43.63641)\n##  2       43    53  (-79.3985 43.63736)\n##  3       61    89 (-79.40028 43.63664)\n##  4      296   348 (-79.39922 43.63928)\n##  5      151   204 (-79.40401 43.64293)\n##  6        2    11 (-79.43941 43.63712)\n##  7      161   174 (-79.43511 43.63869)\n##  8      221   605  (-79.38188 43.6776)\n##  9       68   213 (-79.52078 43.70176)\n## 10        4    14 (-79.43094 43.64027)\n## # ... with 1,690 more rows\n```\n\n<p>Okay, we’re finally there. We have our census tract data in <code>to_census_tracts</code> and our voting data in <code>to_geo_votes</code>. We want to aggregate the votes into each census tract by summing the votes at each voting location within each census tract. We use the <code>aggregate</code> function for this.</p>\n\n```R\nct_votes_wide <- aggregate(x = to_geo_votes, \n                           by = to_census_tracts, \n                           FUN = sum)\nct_votes_wide\n```\n\n```R\n## Simple feature collection with 522 features and 2 fields\n## geometry type:  MULTIPOLYGON\n## dimension:      XY\n## bbox:           xmin: -79.6393 ymin: 43.58107 xmax: -79.11547 ymax: 43.85539\n## epsg (SRID):    4326\n## proj4string:    +proj=longlat +datum=WGS84 +no_defs\n## First 10 features:\n##    Keesmaat Tory                       geometry\n## 1       407  459 MULTIPOLYGON (((-79.39659 4...\n## 2      1103 2400 MULTIPOLYGON (((-79.38782 4...\n## 3       403 1117 MULTIPOLYGON (((-79.27941 4...\n## 4        96  570 MULTIPOLYGON (((-79.28156 4...\n## 5       169  682 MULTIPOLYGON (((-79.49104 4...\n## 6       121  450 MULTIPOLYGON (((-79.54422 4...\n## 7        42   95 MULTIPOLYGON (((-79.45379 4...\n## 8       412  512 MULTIPOLYGON (((-79.33895 4...\n## 9        83  132 MULTIPOLYGON (((-79.35427 4...\n## 10       92  629 MULTIPOLYGON (((-79.44554 4...]\n```\n\n<p>As a last step, to tidy up, we now convert the wide table with a column for each candidate into a long table that has just one candidate column containing the name of the candidate.</p>\n\n```R \nct_votes <- tidyr::gather(ct_votes_wide, candidate, votes, -geometry)\nct_votes\n```\n\n```R\n## Simple feature collection with 1044 features and 2 fields\n## geometry type:  MULTIPOLYGON\n## dimension:      XY\n## bbox:           xmin: -79.6393 ymin: 43.58107 xmax: -79.11547 ymax: 43.85539\n## epsg (SRID):    4326\n## proj4string:    +proj=longlat +datum=WGS84 +no_defs\n## First 10 features:\n##    candidate votes                       geometry\n## 1   Keesmaat   407 MULTIPOLYGON (((-79.39659 4...\n## 2   Keesmaat  1103 MULTIPOLYGON (((-79.38782 4...\n## 3   Keesmaat   403 MULTIPOLYGON (((-79.27941 4...\n## 4   Keesmaat    96 MULTIPOLYGON (((-79.28156 4...\n## 5   Keesmaat   169 MULTIPOLYGON (((-79.49104 4...\n## 6   Keesmaat   121 MULTIPOLYGON (((-79.54422 4...\n## 7   Keesmaat    42 MULTIPOLYGON (((-79.45379 4...\n## 8   Keesmaat   412 MULTIPOLYGON (((-79.33895 4...\n## 9   Keesmaat    83 MULTIPOLYGON (((-79.35427 4...\n## 10  Keesmaat    92 MULTIPOLYGON (((-79.44554 4...\n```\n\n<p>Now that we have votes aggregated by census tract, we can add in many other attributes from the census data. We won’t do that here, since this post is already pretty long. But, we’ll end with a plot to show how easily <code>sf</code> integrates with <code>ggplot2</code>. This is a nice improvement from past workflows, when several steps were required. In the actual <a href=\"https://github.com/Psepho/to2018retrospective/blob/master/compare_pred_actual_2018.Rmd\">code for the retrospective analysis</a>, I added some other plotting techniques, like cutting the response variable (votes) into equally spaced pieces and adding some more refined labels. Here, we’ll just produce a simple plot.</p>\n\n```R \nggplot2::ggplot(data = ct_votes) +\n  ggplot2::geom_sf(ggplot2::aes(fill = votes)) +\n  ggplot2::facet_wrap(~candidate)\n```\n\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/6287/2019/40fe117602.png\" width=\"672\" /></p>\n",
