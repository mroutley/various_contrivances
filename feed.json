And I think it's mostly open to interpretation, but I'm kind of thinking an album that you would say you could just start from beginning, let it run all the way through, without skipping songs, without moving around, just front to back and just sit there and do nothing else and just listen to that whole album.\n> \n> What would that album be?\n\nAn important, though fraught, question. \n\nI completely agree with [Andrew](https://canion.omg.lol/) that [OK Computer](https://music.apple.com/us/album/ok-computer/1097861387) and [Dark Side of the Moon](https://music.apple.com/us/album/the-dark-side-of-the-moon-50th-anniversary-remastered/1665303755) both belong on the list. After that, there's great opportunity to overthink this. Instead, I'm going with albums that were significant to me and, so, came to mind quickly.\n\n## The Joshua Tree by U2 (1987)\n<iframe allow=\"autoplay *; encrypted-media *; fullscreen *; clipboard-write\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"450\" style=\"width:100%;max-width:660px;overflow:hidden;border-radius:10px;\" sandbox=\"allow-forms allow-popups allow-same-origin allow-scripts allow-storage-access-by-user-activation allow-top-navigation-by-user-activation\" src=\"https://embed.music.apple.com/us/album/the-joshua-tree/1443155637\"></iframe>\n\n## Violator by Depeche Mode (1990)\n<iframe allow=\"autoplay *; encrypted-media *; fullscreen *; clipboard-write\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"450\" style=\"width:100%;max-width:660px;overflow:hidden;border-radius:10px;\" sandbox=\"allow-forms allow-popups allow-same-origin allow-scripts allow-storage-access-by-user-activation allow-top-navigation-by-user-activation\" src=\"https://embed.music.apple.com/us/album/violator/665404621\"></iframe>\n\n## Ten by Pearl Jam (1991)\n\n<iframe allow=\"autoplay *; encrypted-media *; fullscreen *; clipboard-write\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"450\" style=\"width:100%;max-width:660px;overflow:hidden;border-radius:10px;\" sandbox=\"allow-forms allow-popups allow-same-origin allow-scripts allow-storage-access-by-user-activation allow-top-navigation-by-user-activation\" src=\"https://embed.music.apple.com/us/album/ten/425465247\"></iframe>\n\n## Us by Peter Gabriel (1992)\n<iframe allow=\"autoplay *; encrypted-media *; fullscreen *; clipboard-write\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"450\" style=\"width:100%;max-width:660px;overflow:hidden;border-radius:10px;\" sandbox=\"allow-forms allow-popups allow-same-origin allow-scripts allow-storage-access-by-user-activation allow-top-navigation-by-user-activation\" src=\"https://embed.music.apple.com/us/album/us-remastered/987396877\"></iframe>\n\n## The Downward Spiral by Nine Inch Nails (1994)\n<iframe allow=\"autoplay *; encrypted-media *; fullscreen *; clipboard-write\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"450\" style=\"width:100%;max-width:660px;overflow:hidden;border-radius:10px;\" sandbox=\"allow-forms allow-popups allow-same-origin allow-scripts allow-storage-access-by-user-activation allow-top-navigation-by-user-activation\" src=\"https://embed.music.apple.com/us/album/the-downward-spiral/1440837096\"></iframe>\n\n## Yankee Hotel Foxtrot by Wilco (2001)\n<iframe allow=\"autoplay *; encrypted-media *; fullscreen *; clipboard-write\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"450\" style=\"width:100%;max-width:660px;overflow:hidden;border-radius:10px;\" sandbox=\"allow-forms allow-popups allow-same-origin allow-scripts allow-storage-access-by-user-activation allow-top-navigation-by-user-activation\" src=\"https://embed.music.apple.com/us/album/yankee-hotel-foxtrot/912314323\"></iframe>\n\n## Give up by The Postal Service (2003)\n<iframe allow=\"autoplay *; encrypted-media *; fullscreen *; clipboard-write\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"450\" style=\"width:100%;max-width:660px;overflow:hidden;border-radius:10px;\" sandbox=\"allow-forms allow-popups allow-same-origin allow-scripts allow-storage-access-by-user-activation allow-top-navigation-by-user-activation\" src=\"https://embed.music.apple.com/us/album/give-up-deluxe-10th-anniversary-edition/597936899\"></iframe>\n\n## Funeral by Arcade Fire (2004)\n<iframe allow=\"autoplay *; encrypted-media *; fullscreen *; clipboard-write\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"450\" style=\"width:100%;max-width:660px;overflow:hidden;border-radius:10px;\" sandbox=\"allow-forms allow-popups allow-same-origin allow-scripts allow-storage-access-by-user-activation allow-top-navigation-by-user-activation\" src=\"https://embed.music.apple.com/us/album/funeral/1249417623\"></iframe>\n\n## For Emma, Forever Ago by Bon Iver (2007)\n<iframe allow=\"autoplay *; encrypted-media *; fullscreen *; clipboard-write\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"450\" style=\"width:100%;max-width:660px;overflow:hidden;border-radius:10px;\" sandbox=\"allow-forms allow-popups allow-same-origin allow-scripts allow-storage-access-by-user-activation allow-top-navigation-by-user-activation\" src=\"https://embed.music.apple.com/us/album/for-emma-forever-ago/947059824\"></iframe>\n\nI also find it interesting that nothing comes to mind from the last 20 years. Is that because no one makes perfect albums anymore? Seems unlikely. More likely that our musical tastes get set when we're younger and that I rarely listen to an actual album anymore. I can change this. \n",

Journal is only on the iPhone.\n* DayOne is my memory archive. I can search for entries with many attributes (like dates), while also organizing with tags and separate journals. Plus, the On This Day feature is great for revisiting old entries. Journal only lets you filter by entry type. There is no search feature.\n* There are many ways to get content into DayOne, including via Shortcuts. Journal is much less accommodating and, oddly, has no Shortcuts support. A related feature in DayOne is templates, which I use frequently and Journal lacks.\n* Given how valuable (to me) content is in DayOne, I appreciate the broad set of export features. Best I can tell, there’s no way to export from Journal.\n\nGiven all of this, why am I drawn to Journal? \n\nThe primary answer is an appeal to simplicity (which Journal certainly has). I do worry sometimes that my structure of separate journals, tags, and templates in DayOne is unecessary complexity. A secondary answer is my policy of [favouring default apps](https://matt.routleynet.org/2023/12/04/even-more-defaults.html) when they’re good enough. Journal is likely quite adequate for many people, especially those that journal to get ideas out of their heads, rather than as a memory archive that they review.\n\n<img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/6287/2024/media.png\" height=\"400\" alt=\"Screenshot from Journal showing a few entries\">\n\nHaving written this down, the answer seems clear: keep using DayOne. Perhaps, though, I should revisit my DayOne structure to get some of that appealing simplicity from Journal.\n",

There were two stickers for the bike, both of which had my bib number on them and matched the number on my wristband. Staff at the transition entrance used these to make sure the bike belonged to me, before letting me in. Then I tracked down my transition spot, which was nicely equidistant from the swim, bike, and run entrances.</p>\n<p>That was it for the Saturday events, other than eating some <a href=\"https://i-my-thai.business.site/\">tasty Thai food</a> and getting a good night&rsquo;s sleep. Sunday (race day) started early, so that I could set up my transition area by 6:30. I took about 10 minutes to get everything organized and visualize how I&rsquo;d move through the zone.</p>\n<h2 id=\"swim\">Swim</h2>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<p>We were organized into age groups for the swim start.

During this, I was able to wiggle out of the top half of my wetsuit, in preparation for the rest of the transition. Once I was at my transition spot, I pulled off the wetsuit and quickly consumed one <a href=\"https://endurancetap.com/products/caffeinated-energy-gel-can\">caffeinated gel</a>.
