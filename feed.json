The Shortcut checks first to see if the highlight is already captured in a note to prevent duplication. It also checks to see if there‚Äôs already a note for the webpage, just with a different highlight, and appends the highlight to that note, instead of creating a new one.</p>\n\n<p>At least, that‚Äôs the idea. I‚Äôve found these checks very unreliable. Sometimes the Shortcut finds the match and appends, and sometimes it doesn‚Äôt and creates a new one. Part of the problem seems to be that if there‚Äôs any punctuation in the content, the Notes filter fails. For example, searching for ‚ÄúWe begin with an obstinate fact:‚Äù fails, then remove the ‚Äú:‚Äù and the search work fine. I can use regular expressions to remove all punctuation, but then my notes are all mangled.</p>\n\n<p>After fiddling around with this for a while, I‚Äôm just going to move along and assume it is a bug in the Notes actions for Shortcuts. Perhaps not a fair conclusion. The worst case is that I get one note per highlight, rather than just one note per article, and sporadically a note is duplicated. This isn‚Äôt so bad, and debugging Shortcuts can be a nuisance.

I choose from the list and it creates a meeting note, starts a Timery timer, and opens the link to start the video call (typically Teams). The meeting note has the name of the meeting as the title, adds tags for #meeting and the Timery project, adds the date and time of the meeting, a list of attendees, and any notes from the calendar event. From this structure, I can then add notes throughout the meeting and extract any tasks into Reminders later.</p>\n\n<p>I used <a href=\"https://matt.routleynet.org/2019/10/15/task-management-with.html\">Agenda</a> for these sorts of notes before, which was powerful.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"daily-summaries\">Daily summaries</h2>\n\n<p>Occasionally, I find myself at the end of a week with no clear sense of what I actually accomplished.

This makes a note of the meetings I attended, tasks I completed, and tasks I created. These all get saved to a Daily Notes folder. I then use the day‚Äôs work report to pull out the highlights for Day One. There‚Äôs some redundancy here, though I find the process of choosing just three things for Day One is helpful.</p>\n\n<p>Overall, I think that Day One is a better app for this use case.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"project-notes\">Project notes</h2>\n\n<p>For each of my projects, I create a project note that states the purpose or objective of the project, key stakeholders, and timelines. Then I accumulate relevant notes and documents while making progress on the project.

Often a good third of my analytical scripts are devoted to accessing and processing data from the Statistics Canada website, which always seems like a waste of effort and good opportunity for making silly errors. So, I was keen to test out the [`cansim`package](https://mountainmath.github.io/cansim/index.html) for R to see how it might help. The quick answer is \"very much\".\n\nThe [documentation](https://mountainmath.github.io/cansim/articles/cansim.html) for the `cansim` package is thorough and doesn't need to be repeated here. I thought it might be useful to illustrate how helpful the package can be by refactoring [some earlier work](https://matt.routleynet.org/2020/01/10/things-cost-more.html) that explored consumer price inflation.\n\nThese scripts always start off with downloading and extracting the relevant data file:\n\n```\ncpi_url <- \"https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/n1/tbl/csv/18100004-eng.zip\" # (1)\nif(file.exists(\"18100004-eng.zip\")) { # (2)\n    # Already downloaded\n  }  else {\n    download.file(cpi_url,\n      destfile = \"18100004-eng.zip\", \n      quiet = TRUE)\n    unzip(\"18100004-eng.zip\") # (3)\n  }\ncpi <- readr::read_csv(\"18100004.csv\") # (4)\n```\n A few things to note here:\n\n1. You need to know the url for the data. Sometimes the logic is clear and you can guess, but often that doesn't work and you need to spelunk through the Stats Can website\n2. To avoid downloading the file every time I run the script, there's a test to see if the file already exists\n3. This approach yields lots of files and folders that you need to manage, including making sure they're ignored by version control\n4. Using the great `readr` package imports the final csv file\n\nWith `cansim` all I need to know is the data series number:\n\n```\ncansim_table <- \"18-10-0004\"\ncpi <- cansim::get_cansim(cansim_table)\n```\n\n`get_cansim`downloads the right file to a temporary directory, extracts the data, and imports it as a `tidyverse`-compatible data frame.\n\nThe `get_cansim` function has some other nice features.

				"content_html": "<p>There&rsquo;s been a fair bit of <a href=\"https://micro.blog/SteveSawczyn/10839912\">discussion</a> over on Micro.blog about podcast players recently. I&rsquo;ve switched among <a href=\"https://overcast.fm/\">Overcast</a>, <a href=\"https://castro.fm/\">Castro</a>, and <a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/ca/app/apple-podcasts/id525463029\">Apple Podcasts</a> players over the years and, mostly to help myself think it through (again), here are my thoughts.</p>\n\n<p>For me, there are three main criteria: audio quality, episode management, and OS integration. Though, I completely understand that others may have different criteria.</p>\n\n<p>Like most podcast listeners, I listen at high speed, usually around 1.5x, which can distort the audio. Apple Podcasts player is definitely the worst for this criterion. For me, Overcast&rsquo;s smart speed and voice boost features give it the edge over Castro, in terms of audio quality at increased speeds.</p>\n\n<p>Castro is definitely the player of choice if you subscribe to more podcasts than you can listen to. The queue management features in Castro are very good. You can replicate some of this with Overcast, but that isn&rsquo;t one of the app&rsquo;s main features.

				"content_text": "There's been a fair bit of [discussion](https://micro.blog/SteveSawczyn/10839912) over on Micro.blog about podcast players recently. I've switched among [Overcast](https://overcast.fm/), [Castro](https://castro.fm/), and [Apple Podcasts](https://apps.apple.com/ca/app/apple-podcasts/id525463029) players over the years and, mostly to help myself think it through (again), here are my thoughts.\n\nFor me, there are three main criteria: audio quality, episode management, and OS integration. Though, I completely understand that others may have different criteria. \n\nLike most podcast listeners, I listen at high speed, usually around 1.5x, which can distort the audio. Apple Podcasts player is definitely the worst for this criterion. For me, Overcast's smart speed and voice boost features give it the edge over Castro, in terms of audio quality at increased speeds.\n\nCastro is definitely the player of choice if you subscribe to more podcasts than you can listen to. The queue management features in Castro are very good. You can replicate some of this with Overcast, but that isn't one of the app's main features. Apple Podcasts player doesn't offer much in this regard. Despite listing this as a criterion, I've actually elevated to subscription, rather than episode, triage. I [carefully curate my list of podcasts](https://matt.routleynet.org/2019/12/15/declaring-podcasts-bankruptcy.html) and don't add new ones very often.

This may change once Overcast releases a widget.\n\nAs just one example of the integration, here‚Äôs what happens when I plug headphones into my iPhone: a selection of music playlists and podcasts appears. I use this feature *a lot*. \n\n<img src=\"https://matt.routleynet.org/uploads/2021/e24fc8a36f.jpg\" width=\"600\" height=\"600\" alt=\"Screenshot of the iOS audio widget\" />\n\nAfter all that, I'm using Apple Podcasts for now, mostly to take advantage of the OS integrations while I'm experimenting with a widget-based iPhone.

Here's an example of creating a table of daily counts and cumulative totals:\n\n```R\ndata_source <- \"[data.ontario.ca/dataset/f...](https://data.ontario.ca/dataset/f4112442-bdc8-45d2-be3c-12efae72fb27/resource/455fd63b-603d-4608-8216-7d8647f43350/download/conposcovidloc.csv)\"\ncovid_data <- read_csv(data_source) %>% \n  select(ACCURATE_EPISODE_DATE) %>% \n  rename(date = ACCURATE_EPISODE_DATE) %>% \n  group_by(date) %>% \n  summarise(daily_count = n()) %>% \n  mutate(cumulative_count = cumsum(daily_count))\n```\n\nFrom there we can make some simple plots to get a sense of how the case load is changing.\n\n![](https://matt.routleynet.org/uploads/2020/4600fe0118.jpg)\n\n![](https://matt.routleynet.org/uploads/2020/1cfffb7503.jpg)\n\nAnd, I'll leave it at that, at least for public posting ü§ì\n",

[Micro.blog](https://micro.blog) seems like a great home for this, as well described in [this post from Manton Reece](https://www.manton.org/2019/06/02/open-gardens.html) (micro.blog's creator). So, I've consolidated almost everything [here](https://matt.routleynet.org). All that‚Äôs left out is Facebook, which I may just leave alone.\n\nBy starting with micro.blog, I can selectively send content to other sites, while everything is still available from one source. I think this is a much better approach and I‚Äôm happy to be part of the open indie web again.\n",

				"title": "Commiting to a Fitness Challenge and Then Figuring Out if it is Achievable",
				"content_html": "<p>My <a href=\"https://www.torqride.com/\">favourite spin studio</a> has put on a fitness challenge for 2019. It has many components, one of which is improving your performance by 3% over six weeks. I‚Äôve taken on the challenge and am now worried that I don‚Äôt know how reasonable this increase actually is. So, a perfect excuse to extract my metrics and perform some excessive analysis.</p>\n<p>We start by importing a CSV file of my stats, taken from Torq‚Äôs website. We use <code>readr</code> for this and set the <code>col_types</code> in advance to specify the type for each column, as well as skip some extra columns with <code>col_skip</code>. I find doing this at the same time as the import, rather than later in the process, more direct and efficient. I also like the flexibility of the <code>col_date</code> import, where I can convert the source data (e.g., ‚ÄúMon 11/02/19 - 6:10 AM‚Äù) into a format <a href=\"https://xkcd.com/1179/\">more useful for analysis</a> (e.g., ‚Äú2019-02-11‚Äù).</p>\n<p>One last bit of clean up is to specify the instructors that have led 5 or more sessions. Later, we‚Äôll try to identify an instructor-effect on my performance and only 5 of the 10 instructors have sufficient data for such an analysis. The <code>forcats::fct_other</code> function is really handy for this: it collapses several factor levels together into one ‚ÄúOther‚Äù level.</p>\n<p>Lastly, I set the <code>challenge_start_date</code> variable for use later on.</p>\n<pre class=\"r\"><code>col_types = cols(\n  Date = col_date(format = \"%a %d/%m/%y - %H:%M %p\"),\n  Ride = col_skip(),\n  Instructor = col_character(),\n  Spot = col_skip(),\n  `Avg RPM` = col_skip(),\n  `Max RPM` = col_skip(),\n  `Avg Power` = col_double(),\n  `Max Power` = col_double(),\n  `Total Energy` = col_double(),\n  `Dist.

Given relatively high variability from class to class, we add a smoothed line to show the overall trend. We also mark the point where the challenge starts with a red line.</p>\n<pre class=\"r\"><code>ggplot2::ggplot(data, aes(x = Date, y = avg_power)) +\n  ggplot2::geom_point() +\n  ggplot2::geom_line() +\n  geom_smooth(method = \"loess\") +\n  ggplot2::ylab(\"Average power\") +\n  ggplot2::geom_vline(xintercept = challenge_start_date, col = \"red\")</code></pre>\n<p><img src=\"https://matt.routleynet.org/uploads/2019/f229b3bab4.png\" width=\"672\" /></p>\n<p>Overall, looks like I made some steady progress when I started, plateaued in the Summer (when I didn‚Äôt ride as often), and then started a slow, steady increase in the Fall. Unfortunately for me, it also looks like I started to plateau in my improvement just in time for the challenge.</p>\n<p>We‚Äôll start a more formal analysis by just testing to see what my average improvement is over time.</p>\n<pre class=\"r\"><code>time_model <- lm(avg_power ~ Date, data = data)\nsummary(time_model)</code></pre>\n<pre><code>## \n## Call:\n## lm(formula = avg_power ~ Date, data = data)\n## \n## Residuals:\n##     Min      1Q  Median      3Q     Max \n## -30.486 -11.356  -1.879  11.501  33.838 \n## \n## Coefficients:\n##               Estimate Std.

But, interpreting the coefficient for time isn‚Äôt entirely intuitive and isn‚Äôt really the point of the challenge. The question is: how much higher is my average power during the challenge than before? For that, we‚Äôll set up a ‚Äúdummy variable‚Äù based on the date of the class. Then we use <code>dplyr</code> to group by this variable and estimate the mean of the average power in both time periods.</p>\n<pre class=\"r\"><code>data %<>% \n  dplyr::mutate(in_challenge = ifelse(Date > challenge_start_date, 1, 0)) \n(change_in_power <- data %>% \n  dplyr::group_by(in_challenge) %>% \n  dplyr::summarize(mean_avg_power = mean(avg_power)))</code></pre>\n<pre><code>## # A tibble: 2 x 2\n##   in_challenge mean_avg_power\n##          <dbl>          <dbl>\n## 1            0           213.\n## 2            1           231.</code></pre>\n<p>So, I‚Äôve improved from an average power of 213 to 231 for a improvement of 8%. A great relief: I‚Äôve exceeded the target!</p>\n<p>Of course, having gone to all of this (excessive?) trouble, now I‚Äôm interested in seeing if the instructor leading the class has a significant impact on my results. I certainly feel as if some instructors are harder than others. But, is this supported by my actual results? As always, we start with a plot to get a visual sense of the data.</p>\n<pre class=\"r\"><code>ggplot2::ggplot(data, aes(x = Date, y = avg_power)) +\n  ggplot2::geom_point() +\n  ggplot2::geom_line() +\n  ggplot2::geom_smooth(method = \"lm\", se = FALSE) +\n  ggplot2::facet_wrap(~Instructor) +\n  ggplot2::ylab(\"Average power\")</code></pre>\n<p><img src=\"https://matt.routleynet.org/uploads/2019/8e09c63772.png\" width=\"672\" /></p>\n<p>There‚Äôs a mix of confirmation and rejection of my expectations here:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Charlotte got me started and there‚Äôs a clear trend of increasing power as I figure out the bikes and gain fitness</li>\n<li>George‚Äôs class is always fun, but my progress isn‚Äôt as high as I‚Äôd like (indicated by the shallower slope).

				"content_text": "<p>My <a href=\"https://www.torqride.com/\">favourite spin studio</a> has put on a fitness challenge for 2019. It has many components, one of which is improving your performance by 3% over six weeks. I‚Äôve taken on the challenge and am now worried that I don‚Äôt know how reasonable this increase actually is. So, a perfect excuse to extract my metrics and perform some excessive analysis.</p>\n<p>We start by importing a CSV file of my stats, taken from Torq‚Äôs website. We use <code>readr</code> for this and set the <code>col_types</code> in advance to specify the type for each column, as well as skip some extra columns with <code>col_skip</code>. I find doing this at the same time as the import, rather than later in the process, more direct and efficient. I also like the flexibility of the <code>col_date</code> import, where I can convert the source data (e.g., ‚ÄúMon 11/02/19 - 6:10 AM‚Äù) into a format <a href=\"https://xkcd.com/1179/\">more useful for analysis</a> (e.g., ‚Äú2019-02-11‚Äù).</p>\n<p>One last bit of clean up is to specify the instructors that have led 5 or more sessions. Later, we‚Äôll try to identify an instructor-effect on my performance and only 5 of the 10 instructors have sufficient data for such an analysis. The <code>forcats::fct_other</code> function is really handy for this: it collapses several factor levels together into one ‚ÄúOther‚Äù level.</p>\n<p>Lastly, I set the <code>challenge_start_date</code> variable for use later on.</p>\n<pre class=\"r\"><code>col_types = cols(\n  Date = col_date(format = \"%a %d/%m/%y - %H:%M %p\"),\n  Ride = col_skip(),\n  Instructor = col_character(),\n  Spot = col_skip(),\n  `Avg RPM` = col_skip(),\n  `Max RPM` = col_skip(),\n  `Avg Power` = col_double(),\n  `Max Power` = col_double(),\n  `Total Energy` = col_double(),\n  `Dist.

When comparing these models with an ANOVA though, we find that there isn‚Äôt a significant difference between them.</p>\n<p>The last model to try is to look for a time by instructor interaction.</p>\n<pre class=\"r\"><code>time_instructor_interaction_model <- update(time_model, . ~ . * Instructor)\nsummary(time_instructor_interaction_model)</code></pre>\n<pre><code>## \n## Call:\n## lm(formula = avg_power ~ Date + Instructor + Date:Instructor, \n##     data = data)\n## \n## Residuals:\n##     Min      1Q  Median      3Q     Max \n## -31.328  -9.899   0.963  10.018  26.128 \n## \n## Coefficients:\n##                          Estimate Std.

Before getting too excited though, an ANOVA shows that this model isn‚Äôt any better than the simple model of just time. There‚Äôs always a risk with trying to explain main effects (like time) with interactions. The story here is really that we need more data to tease out the impacts of the instructor by time effect.</p>\n<p>The last point to make is that we‚Äôve focused so far on the average power, since that‚Äôs the metric for this fitness challenge. There could be interesting interactions among average power, maximum power, RPMs, and total energy, each of which is available in these data. I‚Äôll return to that analysis some other time.</p>\n<p>In the interests of science, I‚Äôll keep going to these classes, just so we can figure out what impact instructors have on performance. In the meantime, looks like I‚Äôll succeed with at least this component of the fitness challenge and I have the stats to prove it.</p>\n",

This was my first, serious use of the new <a href=\"https://r-spatial.github.io/sf/\"><code>sf</code> package</a> for geospatial analysis.

The first 13 columns are data within the original shapefile. The last column is a <a href=\"https://www.rstudio.com/resources/videos/how-to-work-with-list-columns/\">list column</a> that is added by <code>sf</code> and contains the geometry of the location. This specific design feature is what makes an <code>sf</code> object work really well with the rest of the tidyverse: the geographical details are just a column in the data frame. This makes the data much easier to work with than in other approaches, where the data is contained within an <code>@data</code> slot of an object.</p>\n<p>Plotting the data is straightforward, since <code>sf</code> objects have a <code>plot</code> function. Here‚Äôs an example where we plot the number of voters (<code>VOTER_CNT</code>) at each location. If you squint just right, you can see the general outline of Toronto in these points.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://matt.routleynet.org/uploads/2019/c1f3d1400b.png\" width=\"672\" /></p>\n<p>What we want to do next is use the voting location data to aggregate the votes cast at each location into census tracts. This then allows us to associate census characteristics (like age and income) with the pattern of votes and develop our statistical relationships for predicting voter behaviour.</p>\n<p>We‚Äôll split this into several steps. The first is downloading and reading the census tract shapefile.</p>\n<pre class=\"r\"><code>download.file(\"[www12.statcan.gc.ca/census-re...](http://www12.statcan.gc.ca/census-recensement/2011/geo/bound-limit/files-fichiers/gct_000b11a_e.zip)\",\n                destfile = \"data-raw/gct_000b11a_e.zip\", quiet = TRUE)\nunzip(\"data-raw/gct_000b11a_e.zip\", exdir=\"data-raw/gct\")\ncensus_tracts <- sf::read_sf(\"data-raw/gct\", layer = \"gct_000b11a_e\") %>%\n  sf::st_transform(crs = \"+init=epsg:4326\")</code></pre>\n<p>Now that we have it, all we really want are the census tracts in Toronto (the shapefile includes census tracts across Canada). We achieve this by intersecting the Toronto voting locations with the census tracts using standard R subsetting notation.</p>\n<pre class=\"r\"><code>to_census_tracts <- census_tracts[toronto_locations,]</code></pre>\n<p>And, we can plot it to see how well the intersection worked. This time we‚Äôll plot the CTUID, which is the unique identifier for each census tract. This doesn‚Äôt mean anything in this context, but adds some nice colour to the plot.</p>\n<pre class=\"r\"><code>plot(to_census_tracts[\"CTUID\"])</code></pre>\n<p><img src=\"https://matt.routleynet.org/uploads/2019/22d42cb3c3.png\" width=\"672\" /></p>\n<p>Now you can really see the shape of Toronto, as well as the size of each census tract.</p>\n<p>Next we need to manipulate the voting data to get votes received by major candidates in the 2018 election. We take these data from the <a href=\"https://github.com/Psepho/toVotes\"><code>toVotes</code> package</a> and arbitrarily set the threshold for major candidates to receiving at least 100,000 votes. This yields our two main candidates: John Tory and Jennifer Keesmaat.</p>\n<pre class=\"r\"><code>major_candidates <- toVotes %>% \n  dplyr::filter(year == 2018) %>%\n  dplyr::group_by(candidate) %>%\n  dplyr::summarise(votes = sum(votes)) %>%\n  dplyr::filter(votes > 100000) %>%\n  dplyr::select(candidate)\nmajor_candidates</code></pre>\n<pre><code>## # A tibble: 2 x 1\n##   candidate        \n##   <chr>            \n## 1 Keesmaat Jennifer\n## 2 Tory John</code></pre>\n<p>Given our goal of aggregating the votes received by each candidate into census tracts, we need a data frame that has each candidate in a separate column. We start by joining the major candidates table to the votes table. In this case, we also filter the votes to 2018, since John Tory has been a candidate in more than one election. Then we use the <code>tidyr</code> package to convert the table from long (with one candidate column) to wide (with a column for each candidate).</p>\n<pre class=\"r\"><code>spread_votes <- toVotes %>%\n  tibble::as.tibble() %>% \n  dplyr::filter(year == 2018) %>%\n  dplyr::right_join(major_candidates) %>%\n  dplyr::select(-type, -year) %>%\n  tidyr::spread(candidate, votes)\nspread_votes</code></pre>\n<pre><code>## # A tibble: 1,800 x 4\n##     ward  area `Keesmaat Jennifer` `Tory John`\n##    <int> <int>               <dbl>       <dbl>\n##  1     1     1                  66         301\n##  2     1     2                  72         376\n##  3     1     3                  40         255\n##  4     1     4                  24         161\n##  5     1     5                  51         211\n##  6     1     6                  74         372\n##  7     1     7                  70         378\n##  8     1     8                  10          77\n##  9     1     9                  11          82\n## 10     1    10                  12          76\n## # ... with 1,790 more rows</code></pre>\n<p>Our last step before finally aggregating to census tracts is to join the <code>spread_votes</code> table with the <code>toronto_locations</code> data.

We won‚Äôt do that here, since this post is already pretty long. But, we‚Äôll end with a plot to show how easily <code>sf</code> integrates with <code>ggplot2</code>.

This was my first, serious use of the new <a href=\"https://r-spatial.github.io/sf/\"><code>sf</code> package</a> for geospatial analysis.

The first 13 columns are data within the original shapefile. The last column is a <a href=\"https://www.rstudio.com/resources/videos/how-to-work-with-list-columns/\">list column</a> that is added by <code>sf</code> and contains the geometry of the location. This specific design feature is what makes an <code>sf</code> object work really well with the rest of the tidyverse: the geographical details are just a column in the data frame. This makes the data much easier to work with than in other approaches, where the data is contained within an <code>@data</code> slot of an object.</p>\n<p>Plotting the data is straightforward, since <code>sf</code> objects have a <code>plot</code> function. Here‚Äôs an example where we plot the number of voters (<code>VOTER_CNT</code>) at each location. If you squint just right, you can see the general outline of Toronto in these points.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://matt.routleynet.org/uploads/2019/c1f3d1400b.png\" width=\"672\" /></p>\n<p>What we want to do next is use the voting location data to aggregate the votes cast at each location into census tracts. This then allows us to associate census characteristics (like age and income) with the pattern of votes and develop our statistical relationships for predicting voter behaviour.</p>\n<p>We‚Äôll split this into several steps. The first is downloading and reading the census tract shapefile.</p>\n<pre class=\"r\"><code>download.file(\"[www12.statcan.gc.ca/census-re...](http://www12.statcan.gc.ca/census-recensement/2011/geo/bound-limit/files-fichiers/gct_000b11a_e.zip)\",\n                destfile = \"data-raw/gct_000b11a_e.zip\", quiet = TRUE)\nunzip(\"data-raw/gct_000b11a_e.zip\", exdir=\"data-raw/gct\")\ncensus_tracts <- sf::read_sf(\"data-raw/gct\", layer = \"gct_000b11a_e\") %>%\n  sf::st_transform(crs = \"+init=epsg:4326\")</code></pre>\n<p>Now that we have it, all we really want are the census tracts in Toronto (the shapefile includes census tracts across Canada). We achieve this by intersecting the Toronto voting locations with the census tracts using standard R subsetting notation.</p>\n<pre class=\"r\"><code>to_census_tracts <- census_tracts[toronto_locations,]</code></pre>\n<p>And, we can plot it to see how well the intersection worked. This time we‚Äôll plot the CTUID, which is the unique identifier for each census tract. This doesn‚Äôt mean anything in this context, but adds some nice colour to the plot.</p>\n<pre class=\"r\"><code>plot(to_census_tracts[\"CTUID\"])</code></pre>\n<p><img src=\"https://matt.routleynet.org/uploads/2019/22d42cb3c3.png\" width=\"672\" /></p>\n<p>Now you can really see the shape of Toronto, as well as the size of each census tract.</p>\n<p>Next we need to manipulate the voting data to get votes received by major candidates in the 2018 election. We take these data from the <a href=\"https://github.com/Psepho/toVotes\"><code>toVotes</code> package</a> and arbitrarily set the threshold for major candidates to receiving at least 100,000 votes. This yields our two main candidates: John Tory and Jennifer Keesmaat.</p>\n<pre class=\"r\"><code>major_candidates <- toVotes %>% \n  dplyr::filter(year == 2018) %>%\n  dplyr::group_by(candidate) %>%\n  dplyr::summarise(votes = sum(votes)) %>%\n  dplyr::filter(votes > 100000) %>%\n  dplyr::select(candidate)\nmajor_candidates</code></pre>\n<pre><code>## # A tibble: 2 x 1\n##   candidate        \n##   <chr>            \n## 1 Keesmaat Jennifer\n## 2 Tory John</code></pre>\n<p>Given our goal of aggregating the votes received by each candidate into census tracts, we need a data frame that has each candidate in a separate column. We start by joining the major candidates table to the votes table. In this case, we also filter the votes to 2018, since John Tory has been a candidate in more than one election. Then we use the <code>tidyr</code> package to convert the table from long (with one candidate column) to wide (with a column for each candidate).</p>\n<pre class=\"r\"><code>spread_votes <- toVotes %>%\n  tibble::as.tibble() %>% \n  dplyr::filter(year == 2018) %>%\n  dplyr::right_join(major_candidates) %>%\n  dplyr::select(-type, -year) %>%\n  tidyr::spread(candidate, votes)\nspread_votes</code></pre>\n<pre><code>## # A tibble: 1,800 x 4\n##     ward  area `Keesmaat Jennifer` `Tory John`\n##    <int> <int>               <dbl>       <dbl>\n##  1     1     1                  66         301\n##  2     1     2                  72         376\n##  3     1     3                  40         255\n##  4     1     4                  24         161\n##  5     1     5                  51         211\n##  6     1     6                  74         372\n##  7     1     7                  70         378\n##  8     1     8                  10          77\n##  9     1     9                  11          82\n## 10     1    10                  12          76\n## # ... with 1,790 more rows</code></pre>\n<p>Our last step before finally aggregating to census tracts is to join the <code>spread_votes</code> table with the <code>toronto_locations</code> data. This requires pulling the ward and area identifiers from the <code>PT_LNG_CD</code> column of the <code>toronto_locations</code> data frame which we do with some <code>stringr</code> functions. While we‚Äôre at it, we also update the candidate names to just surnames.</p>\n<pre class=\"r\"><code>to_geo_votes <- toronto_locations %>%\n  dplyr::mutate(ward = as.integer(stringr::str_sub(PT_LNG_CD, 1, 2)),\n                area = as.integer(stringr::str_sub(PT_LNG_CD, -3, -1))) %>%\n  dplyr::left_join(spread_votes) %>%\n  dplyr::select(`Keesmaat Jennifer`, `Tory John`) %>%\n  dplyr::rename(Keesmaat = `Keesmaat Jennifer`, Tory = `Tory John`)\nto_geo_votes</code></pre>\n<pre><code>## Simple feature collection with 1700 features and 2 fields\n## geometry type:  POINT\n## dimension:      XY\n## bbox:           xmin: -79.61937 ymin: 43.59062 xmax: -79.12531 ymax: 43.83052\n## epsg (SRID):    4326\n## proj4string:    +proj=longlat +datum=WGS84 +no_defs\n## # A tibble: 1,700 x 3\n##    Keesmaat  Tory             geometry\n##       <dbl> <dbl>          <POINT [¬∞]>\n##  1       55   101 (-79.40225 43.63641)\n##  2       43    53  (-79.3985 43.63736)\n##  3       61    89 (-79.40028 43.63664)\n##  4      296   348 (-79.39922 43.63928)\n##  5      151   204 (-79.40401 43.64293)\n##  6        2    11 (-79.43941 43.63712)\n##  7      161   174 (-79.43511 43.63869)\n##  8      221   605  (-79.38188 43.6776)\n##  9       68   213 (-79.52078 43.70176)\n## 10        4    14 (-79.43094 43.64027)\n## # ... with 1,690 more rows</code></pre>\n<p>Okay, we‚Äôre finally there.

				"content_html": "<p>In my <a href=\"https://matt.routleynet.org/2019/05/23/elections-ontario-official.html\">Elections Ontario official results</a> post, I had to use an ugly hack to match Electoral District names and numbers by extracting data from a drop down list on the Find My Electoral District website. Although it was mildly clever, like any hack, I shouldn‚Äôt have relied on this one for long, as proven by Elections Ontario shutting down the website.</p>\n<p>So, a more robust solution was required, which led to using one of Election Ontario‚Äôs shapefiles. The shapefile contains the data we need, it‚Äôs just in a tricky format to deal with. But, the <code>sf</code> package makes this mostly straightforward.</p>\n<p>We start by downloading and importing the Elections Ontario shape file.

As provided, the data is really difficult to work with and we‚Äôll walk through some steps to tidy these data for later analysis.</p>\n<p>Here‚Äôs what the source data looks like:</p>\n<div class=\"figure\">\n<img src=\"https://matt.routleynet.org/uploads/2019/90081f2261.png\" alt=\"Screenshot of raw Elections Ontario data\" />\n<p class=\"caption\">Screenshot of raw Elections Ontario data</p>\n</div>\n<p>A few problems with this:</p>\n<ol style=\"list-style-type: decimal\">\n<li>The data is scattered across a hundred different Excel files</li>\n<li>Candidates are in columns with their last name as the header</li>\n<li>Last names are not unique across all Electoral Districts, so can‚Äôt be used as a unique identifier</li>\n<li>Electoral District names are in a row, followed by a separate row for each poll within the district</li>\n<li>The party affiliation for each candidate isn‚Äôt included in the data</li>\n</ol>\n<p>So, we have a fair bit of work to do to get to something more useful. Ideally something like:</p>\n\n<pre><code>## # A tibble: 9 x 5\n##   electoral_district  poll candidate   party votes\n##                &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt;     &lt;chr&gt;   &lt;chr&gt; &lt;int&gt;\n## 1                  X     1         A Liberal    37\n## 2                  X     2         B     NDP    45\n## 3                  X     3         C      PC    33\n## 4                  Y     1         A Liberal    71\n## 5                  Y     2         B     NDP    37\n## 6                  Y     3         C      PC    69\n## 7                  Z     1         A Liberal    28\n## 8                  Z     2         B     NDP    15\n## 9                  Z     3         C      PC    34\n</code></pre>\n\n<p><p>This is much easier to work with: we have one row for the votes received by each candidate at each poll, along with the Electoral District name and their party affiliation.</p>\n<div id=\"candidate-parties\" class=\"section level2\">\n<h2>Candidate parties</h2>\n<p>As a first step, we need the party affiliation for each candidate. I didn‚Äôt see this information on the Elections Ontario site. So, we‚Äôll pull the data from <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ontario_general_election,_2014#Candidates_by_region\">Wikipedia</a>. The data on this webpage isn‚Äôt too bad. We can just use the <code>table</code> xpath selector to pull out the tables and then drop the ones we aren‚Äôt interested in.</p>\n<pre class=\"r\"></p>\n\n<pre><code>candidate_webpage &lt;- &quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ontario_general_election,_2014#Candidates_by_region&quot;\ncandidate_tables &lt;- &quot;table&quot; # Use an xpath selector to get the drop down list by ID\n\ncandidates &lt;- xml2::read_html(candidate_webpage) %&gt;%\n  rvest::html_nodes(candidate_tables) %&gt;% # Pull tables from the wikipedia entry\n  .[13:25] %&gt;% # Drop unecessary tables\n  rvest::html_table(fill = TRUE)\n</code></pre>\n\n<p></pre>\n<p>This gives us a list of 13 data frames, one for each table on the webpage. Now we cycle through each of these and stack them into one data frame. Unfortunately, the tables aren‚Äôt consistent in the number of columns. So, the approach is a bit messy and we process each one in a loop.</p>\n<pre class=\"r\"><code># Setup empty dataframe to store results\ncandidate_parties &lt;- tibble::as_tibble(\n  electoral_district_name = NULL,\n  party = NULL,\n  candidate = NULL\n)</p>\n\n<p>for(i in seq_along(1:length(candidates))) { # Messy, but works\n  this_table &lt;- candidates[[i]]\n  # The header spans mess up the header row, so renaming\n  names(this_table) &lt;- c(this_table[1,-c(3,4)], &ldquo;NA&rdquo;, &ldquo;Incumbent&rdquo;)\n  # Get rid of the blank spacer columns\n  this_table &lt;- this_table[-1, ]\n  # Drop the NA columns by keeping only odd columns\n  this_table &lt;- this_table[,seq(from = 1, to = dim(this_table)[2], by = 2)]\n  this_table %&lt;&gt;%\n    tidyr::gather(party, candidate, -<code>Electoral District</code>) %&gt;%\n    dplyr::rename(electoral_district_name = <code>Electoral District</code>) %&gt;%\n    dplyr::filter(party != &ldquo;Incumbent&rdquo;)\n  candidate_parties &lt;- dplyr::bind_rows(candidate_parties, this_table)\n}\ncandidate_parties</code></pre>\n<pre></p>\n\n<pre><code>## # A tibble: 649 x 3\n##       electoral_district_name   party            candidate\n##                         &lt;chr&gt;   &lt;chr&gt;                &lt;chr&gt;\n##  1 Carleton‚ÄîMississippi Mills Liberal      Rosalyn Stevens\n##  2            Nepean‚ÄîCarleton Liberal           Jack Uppal\n##  3              Ottawa Centre Liberal          Yasir Naqvi\n##  4             Ottawa‚ÄîOrl√©ans Liberal Marie-France Lalonde\n##  5               Ottawa South Liberal          John Fraser\n##  6              Ottawa‚ÄîVanier Liberal   Madeleine Meilleur\n##  7         Ottawa West‚ÄîNepean Liberal        Bob Chiarelli\n##  8 Carleton‚ÄîMississippi Mills      PC        Jack MacLaren\n##  9            Nepean‚ÄîCarleton      PC         Lisa MacLeod\n## 10              Ottawa Centre      PC           Rob Dekker\n## # ... with 639 more rows\n</code></pre>\n\n<p></pre>\n</div>\n<div id=\"electoral-district-names\" class=\"section level2\">\n<h2>Electoral district names</h2>\n<p>One issue with pulling party affiliations from Wikipedia is that candidates are organized by Electoral District <em>names</em>. But the voting results are organized by Electoral District <em>number</em>. I couldn‚Äôt find an appropriate resource on the Elections Ontario site. Rather, here we pull the names and numbers of the Electoral Districts from the <a href=\"https://www3.elections.on.ca/internetapp/FYED_Error.aspx?lang=en-ca\">Find My Electoral District</a> website. The xpath selector is a bit tricky for this one. The <code>ed_xpath</code> object below actually pulls content from the drop down list that appears when you choose an Electoral District. One nuisance with these data is that Elections Ontario uses <code>&ndash;</code> in the Electoral District names, instead of the ‚Äî used on Wikipedia. We use <code>str_replace_all</code> to fix this below.</p>\n<pre class=\"r\"><code>ed_webpage &lt;- &ldquo;<a href=\"https://www3.elections.on.ca/internetapp/FYED_Error.aspx?lang=en-ca&quot;\">https://www3.elections.on.ca/internetapp/FYED_Error.aspx?lang=en-ca&quot;</a>\ned_xpath &lt;- &ldquo;//*[(@id = \\&ldquo;ddlElectoralDistricts\\&ldquo;)]&rdquo; # Use an xpath selector to get the drop down list by ID</p>\n\n<p>electoral_districts &lt;- xml2::read_html(ed_webpage) %&gt;%\n  rvest::html_node(xpath = ed_xpath) %&gt;%\n  rvest::html_nodes(&ldquo;option&rdquo;) %&gt;%\n  rvest::html_text() %&gt;%\n  .[-1] %&gt;% # Drop the first item on the list (&ldquo;Select&hellip;&rdquo;)\n  tibble::as.tibble() %&gt;% # Convert to a data frame and split into ID number and name\n  tidyr::separate(value, c(&ldquo;electoral_district&rdquo;, &ldquo;electoral_district_name&rdquo;),\n                  sep = &ldquo; &ldquo;,\n                  extra = &ldquo;merge&rdquo;) %&gt;%\n  # Clean up district names for later matching and presentation\n  dplyr::mutate(electoral_district_name = stringr::str_to_title(\n    stringr::str_replace_all(electoral_district_name, &ldquo;&ndash;&rdquo;, &ldquo;‚Äî&rdquo;)))\nelectoral_districts</code></pre></p>\n\n<pre>\n```\n## # A tibble: 107 x 2\n##    electoral_district              electoral_district_name\n##                 <chr>                                <chr>\n##  1                001                       Ajax‚ÄîPickering\n##  2                002                    Algoma‚ÄîManitoulin\n##  3                003 Ancaster‚ÄîDundas‚ÄîFlamborough‚ÄîWestdale\n##  4                004                               Barrie\n##  5                005                    Beaches‚ÄîEast York\n##  6                006                 Bramalea‚ÄîGore‚ÄîMalton\n##  7                007                  Brampton‚ÄîSpringdale\n##  8                008                        Brampton West\n##  9                009                                Brant\n## 10                010                Bruce‚ÄîGrey‚ÄîOwen Sound\n## # ... with 97 more rows\n```\n</pre>\n\n<p><p>Next, we can join the party affiliations to the Electoral District names to join candidates to parties and district numbers.</p>\n<pre class=\"r\"><code>candidate_parties %&lt;&gt;%\n  # These three lines are cleaning up hyphens and dashes, seems overly complicated\n  dplyr::mutate(electoral_district_name = stringr::str_replace_all(electoral_district_name, &ldquo;‚Äî\\n&rdquo;, &ldquo;‚Äî&rdquo;)) %&gt;%\n  dplyr::mutate(electoral_district_name = stringr::str_replace_all(electoral_district_name,\n                                                                   &ldquo;Chatham-Kent‚ÄîEssex&rdquo;,\n                                                                   &ldquo;Chatham‚ÄîKent‚ÄîEssex&rdquo;)) %&gt;%\n  dplyr::mutate(electoral_district_name = stringr::str_to_title(electoral_district_name)) %&gt;%\n  dplyr::left_join(electoral_districts) %&gt;%\n  dplyr::filter(!candidate == &ldquo;&rdquo;) %&gt;%\n  # Since the vote data are identified by last names, we split candidate&rsquo;s names into first and last\n  tidyr::separate(candidate, into = c(&ldquo;first&rdquo;,&ldquo;candidate&rdquo;), extra = &ldquo;merge&rdquo;, remove = TRUE) %&gt;%\n  dplyr::select(-first)</code></pre>\n<pre><code>## Joining, by = &ldquo;electoral_district_name&rdquo;</code></pre>\n<pre class=\"r\"><code>candidate_parties</code></pre>\n<pre></p>\n\n<pre><code>## # A tibble: 578 x 4\n##       electoral_district_name   party      candidate electoral_district\n##  *                      &lt;chr&gt;   &lt;chr&gt;          &lt;chr&gt;              &lt;chr&gt;\n##  1 Carleton‚ÄîMississippi Mills Liberal        Stevens                013\n##  2            Nepean‚ÄîCarleton Liberal          Uppal                052\n##  3              Ottawa Centre Liberal          Naqvi                062\n##  4             Ottawa‚ÄîOrl√©ans Liberal France Lalonde                063\n##  5               Ottawa South Liberal         Fraser                064\n##  6              Ottawa‚ÄîVanier Liberal       Meilleur                065\n##  7         Ottawa West‚ÄîNepean Liberal      Chiarelli                066\n##  8 Carleton‚ÄîMississippi Mills      PC       MacLaren                013\n##  9            Nepean‚ÄîCarleton      PC        MacLeod                052\n## 10              Ottawa Centre      PC         Dekker                062\n## # ... with 568 more rows\n</code></pre>\n\n<p></pre>\n<p>All that work just to get the name of each candiate for each Electoral District name and number, plus their party affiliation.</p>\n</div>\n<div id=\"votes\" class=\"section level2\">\n<h2>Votes</h2>\n<p>Now we can finally get to the actual voting data. These are made available as a collection of Excel files in a compressed folder. To avoid downloading it more than once, we wrap the call in an <code>if</code> statement that first checks to see if we already have the file. We also rename the file to something more manageable.</p>\n<pre class=\"r\"><code>raw_results_file &lt;- &ldquo;<a href=\"http://www.elections.on.ca/content/dam/NGW/sitecontent/2017/results/Poll%20by%20Poll%20Results%20-%20Excel.zip\">www.elections.on.ca/content/d&hellip;</a>&ldquo;</p>\n\n<p>zip_file &lt;- &ldquo;data-raw/Poll%20by%20Poll%20Results%20-%20Excel.zip&rdquo;\nif(file.exists(zip_file)) { # Only download the data once\n  # File exists, so nothing to do\n}  else {\n  download.file(raw_results_file,\n                destfile = zip_file)\n  unzip(zip_file, exdir=&ldquo;data-raw&rdquo;) # Extract the data into data-raw\n  file.rename(&ldquo;data-raw/GE Results - 2014 (unconverted)&rdquo;, &ldquo;data-raw/pollresults&rdquo;)\n}</code></pre>\n<pre><code>## NULL</code></pre>\n<p>Now we need to extract the votes out of 107 Excel files. The combination of <code>purrr</code> and <code>readxl</code> packages is great for this. In case we want to filter to just a few of the files (perhaps to target a range of Electoral Districts), we declare a <code>file_pattern</code>. For now, we just set it to any xls file that ends with three digits preceeded by a ‚Äú_‚Äú.</p>\n<p>As we read in the Excel files, we clean up lots of blank columns and headers. Then we convert to a long table and drop total and blank rows. Also, rather than try to align the Electoral District name rows with their polls, we use the name of the Excel file to pull out the Electoral District number.

Here‚Äôs just a brief summary of some of the main points I tried to make about the differences between academics and public service.</p>\n\n<p>The major difference I‚Äôve experienced involves a trade-off between control and influence.</p>\n\n<p>As a grad student and post-doctoral researcher I had almost complete control over my work. I could decide what was interesting, how to pursue questions, who to talk to, and when to work on specific components of my research. I believe that I made some <a href=\"http://files.me.com/mroutley/o38cwy\">important</a> <a href=\"http://files.me.com/mroutley/xura8h\">contributions</a> to my field of study. But, to be honest, this work had very little influence beyond a small group of colleagues who are also interested in the evolution of floral form.</p>\n\n<p>Now I want to be clear about this: in no way should this be interpreted to mean that scientific research is not important. This is how scientific progress is made ‚Äì many scientists working on particular, specific questions that are aggregated into general knowledge. This work is important and deserves support. Plus, it was incredibly interesting and rewarding.</p>\n\n<p>However, the comparison of the influence of my academic research with my work on infrastructure policy is revealing. Roads, bridges, transit, hospitals, schools, courthouses, and jails all have <a href=\"http://www.mei.gov.on.ca/en/infrastructure/\">significant impacts</a> on the day-to-day experience of millions of people. Every day I am involved in decisions that determine where, when, and how the government will invest scarce resources into these important services.</p>\n\n<p>Of course, this is where the control-influence trade-off kicks in. As an individual public servant, I have very little control over these decisions or how my work will be used. Almost everything I do involves medium-sized teams with members from many departments and ministries. This requires extensive collaboration, often under very tight time constraints with high profile outcomes.</p>\n\n<p>For example, in my first week as a <a href=\"http://www.mei.gov.on.ca/\">public servant</a> I started a year-long process to integrate and enhance decision-making processes across 20 ministries and 2 agencies. The project team included engineers, policy analysts, accountants, lawyers, economists, and external consultants from all of the major government sectors. The (rather long) document produced by this process is now used to inform every infrastructure decision made by the province.</p>\n\n<p>Governments contend with really interesting and complicated problems that no one else can or will consider. Businesses generally take on the easy and profitable issues, while NGOs are able to focus on specific aspects of issues. Consequently, working on government policy provides a seemingly endless supply of challenges and puzzles to solve, or at least mitigate. I find this very rewarding.</p>\n\n<p>None of this is to suggest that either option is better than the other. I‚Äôve been lucky to have had two very interesting careers so far, which have been at the opposite ends of this control-influence trade-off. Nonetheless, my experience suggests that an actual academic career is incredibly challenging to obtain and may require significant compromises. Public service can offer many of the same intellectual challenges with better job prospects and work-life balance.

				"content_html": "<p>My experiences helping people manage their data has repeatedly shown that databases are poorly understood. This is well illustrated by the rampant abuses of spreadsheets for recording, manipulating, and analysing data.</p>\n\n<p>Most people realise that they should be using a database, the real issue is the difficulty of creating a proper database. This is a legitimate challenge. Typically, you need to carefully consider all of the categories of data and their relationships when creating the database, which makes the upfront costs quite significant. Why not just start throwing data into a spreadsheet and worry about it later?</p>\n\n<p>I think that <a href=\"http://dabbledb.com/\">DabbleDB</a> can solve this problem. A great strength of Dabble ‚Äì- and the source of its name ‚Äî is that you can start with a simple spreadsheet of data and progressively convert it to a database as you begin to better understand the data and your requirements.</p>\n\n<p>Dabble also has a host of great features for working with data. I‚Äôll illustrate this with a database I created recently when we were looking for a new home. This is a daunting challenge. We looked at dozens of houses each with unique pros and cons in different neighbourhoods and with different price ranges. I certainly couldn‚Äôt keep track of them all.</p>\n\n<p>I started with a simple list of addresses for consideration. This was easily imported into Dabble and immediately became useful. Dabble can export to <a href=\"http://earth.google.com/\">Google Earth</a>, so I could quickly have an overview of the properties and their proximity to amenities like transit stops and parks. Next, I added in a field for asking price and MLS url which were also exported to Google Earth.

				"content_text": "<p>My experiences helping people manage their data has repeatedly shown that databases are poorly understood. This is well illustrated by the rampant abuses of spreadsheets for recording, manipulating, and analysing data.</p>\n\n<p>Most people realise that they should be using a database, the real issue is the difficulty of creating a proper database. This is a legitimate challenge. Typically, you need to carefully consider all of the categories of data and their relationships when creating the database, which makes the upfront costs quite significant. Why not just start throwing data into a spreadsheet and worry about it later?</p>\n\n<p>I think that <a href=\"http://dabbledb.com/\">DabbleDB</a> can solve this problem. A great strength of Dabble ‚Äì- and the source of its name ‚Äî is that you can start with a simple spreadsheet of data and progressively convert it to a database as you begin to better understand the data and your requirements.</p>\n\n<p>Dabble also has a host of great features for working with data. I‚Äôll illustrate this with a database I created recently when we were looking for a new home. This is a daunting challenge. We looked at dozens of houses each with unique pros and cons in different neighbourhoods and with different price ranges. I certainly couldn‚Äôt keep track of them all.</p>\n\n<p>I started with a simple list of addresses for consideration. This was easily imported into Dabble and immediately became useful. Dabble can export to <a href=\"http://earth.google.com/\">Google Earth</a>, so I could quickly have an overview of the properties and their proximity to amenities like transit stops and parks. Next, I added in a field for asking price and MLS url which were also exported to Google Earth. Including price gave a good sense of how costs varied with location, while the url meant I could quickly view the entire listing for a property.</p>\n\n<p>Next, we started scheduling appointments to view properties. Adding this to Dabble immediately created a calendar view.

				"content_html": "<p>I like to believe that my brain is useful for analysis, synthesis, and creativity. Clearly it is not proficient at storing details like specific dates and looming reminders. Nonetheless, a great deal of my mental energy is devoted to trying to remember such details and fearing the consequences of the inevitable ‚Äúit slipped my mind‚Äù. As counselled by <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GTD\">GTD</a>, I need a good and trustworthy system for removing these important, but distracting, details and having them reappear when needed. I‚Äôve finally settled in on the new product from <a href=\"http://www.valuesofn.com/\">values of n</a> called <a href=\"http://stikkit.com/\">Stikkit</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Stikkit appeals to me for two main reasons: easy data entry and smart text processing. Stikkit uses the metaphor of the yellow sticky note for capturing text. When you create a new note, you are presented with a simple text field ‚Äî nothing more. However, Stikkit parses your note for some key words and extracts information to make the note more useful. For example, if you type:</p>\n\n<pre><code>Phone call with John Smith on Feb 1 at 1pm\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Stikkit realises that you are describing an event scheduled for February 1st at one in the afternoon with a person (‚Äúpeep‚Äù in Stikkit slang) named John Smith. A separate note will be created to track information about John Smith and will be linked to the phone call note. If you add the text ‚Äúremind me‚Äù to the note, Stikkit will send you an email and SMS message prior to the event. You can also include tags to group notes together with the keywords ‚Äútag as‚Äù.</p>\n\n<p>A recent update to peeps makes them even more useful. Stikkit now collects information about people as you create notes. So, for example, if I later post:</p>\n\n<pre><code>- Send documents to John Smith john@smith.net\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Stikkit will recognise John Smith and update my peep for him with the email address provided. In this way, Stikkit becomes more useful as you continue to add information to notes. Also, the prefixed ‚Äú-‚Äù causes Stikkit to recognise this note as a todo. I can then list all of my todos and check them off as they are completed.</p>\n\n<p>This text processing greatly simplifies data entry, since I don‚Äôt need to click around to create todos are choose dates from a calendar picker. Just type in the text, hit save, and I‚Äôm done. Fortunately, Stikkit has been designed to be smart rather than clever. The distinction here is that Stikkit relies on some key words (such as at, for, to) to mark up notes consistently and reliably. Clever software is exemplified by Microsoft Word‚Äôs autocorrect or clipboard assistant. My first goal when encountering these ‚Äúfeatures‚Äù is to turn them off. I find they rarely do the right thing and end up being a hindrance. <a href=\"http://stikkit.com/\">Stikkit</a> is well worth a look.

Bees spent more time foraging on and visited more flowers of larger inflorescences than small. Female outcrossing rates did not vary among inflorescence size treatments.

However, paternal and maternal reproductive success may not increase because within-clone pollination (geitonogamy) can reduce pollen export to adjacent clones (pollen discounting) and pollen import to the central ramets (pollen limitation). We investigated the relationship between clone size and mating success using clones of Malus x domestica at four orchards (blocks of 1‚Äì5 rows of trees). For each block, we measured maternal function as fruit and seed set in all rows and paternal function as siring rate in the first row of the adjacent block. Expected relations between reproductive success and clone size were generated from simulations and data on pollen dispersal in this species. Siring rate per clone averaged 70\\% and did not increase significantly with block size, consistent with simulations of pollen dispersal under pollen discounting. Simulations also indicated that the ratio of compatible to incompatible pollen received by a tree should decline with increased block size and from the periphery to the centre of blocks. However, no significant reductions in female function were detected among block sizes or within blocks.

				"content_html": "<p>Mating by outcrossing plants depends on the frequency and quality of interaction between pollen vectors and individual flowers. However, the historical focus of pollination biology on individual flowers (floricentrism) cannot produce a complete understanding of the role of pollination in plant mating, because mating is an aggregate process, which depends on the reproductive outcomes of all of a plant‚Äôs flowers. Simultaneous display of multiple flowers in an inflorescence increases a plant‚Äôs attractiveness to pollinators, which should generally enhance mating opportunities. However, whenever pollinators visit multiple flowers on an inflorescence, self-pollination among flowers can reduce the pollen available for export to other plants (pollen discounting) and increase the incidence of inbreeding depression for embryos and offspring. Therefore, the size of floral displays that maximizes mating frequency and quality generally balances the benefits of attractiveness against the costs of self-pollination. This balance can shift considerably if different flowers serve female and male functions at one time (sexual segregation) and flowers are arranged in inflorescences so that pollinators visit female flowers before male flowers. However, the effectiveness of sexual segregation depends on the extent to which a particular inflorescence architecture induces consistent movement patterns by pollinators. In general, the consistency of pollinator movement patterns varies with inflorescence architecture and differs between pollinator types.

This analysis clarifies the importance of pollen quantity and quality for seed production, including the opportunity for poor pollen quality to cause misidentification of pollen limitation.

We also identify ovule limitation as a constraint on seed production, which has paradoxically not been recognized before, but is an implicit assumption of previous theoretical analysis of mating-system evolution.  Ovule limitation increases the diversity of possible reproductive policies.  In addition to ovule limitation, we consider the implications of pollen and resource limitation for the evolution of self- and cross-fertilization.  Resource limitation occurs only if plants produce more ovules than they can mature into seeds, which allows a mixture of selfing and outcrossing to be an optimal mating system in some circumstances.  The chance of mixed mating being optimal is eroded by trade-offs between self- and cross-pollination, but they do not alter the optimal combination of selfing and outcrossing, should mixed mating be favoured.

				"title": "Temporal separation of gender",
				"content_html": "<p>Dichogamy, the temporal separation of gender within a flower, is widespread throughout the angiosperms, occurring in over 250 families. There are two forms of dichogamy: protandry, in which male function precedes female function, and protogyny, the converse. Dichogamy has traditionally been interpreted as a mechanism to avoid inbreeding. However, recent evidence indicates that this inbreeding-avoidance hypothesis cannot completely explain the evolution of dichogamy. An alternate hypothesis is that dichogamy acts to reduce interference between gender functions. Interference can occur within a flower or between flowers on an inflorescence and result in substantial reductions in male and female reproductive success. To date there are very few tests of this interference-avoidance hypothesis or, in fact, investigations of the evolution of dichogamy in general. My Ph.D. thesis was a comprehensive evaluation of the evolutionary significance of dichogamy, including functional, genetic, comparative, and theoretical analyses of this important floral character.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://matt.routleynet.org/uploads/2019/02908cc8b7.jpg\" width=\"250\" height=\"331\" alt=\"clint\"/></p>\n\n<p>This Claytonia species is protandrous. The flower on the left is in male phase with its anthers shedding pollen and the stigma closed and unreceptive. The flower on the right is approximately one day older and is in female phase. The stigma is open and receptive and the anthers have moved away to the side and are empty of pollen.</p>\n\n<h2>Functional analyses</h2>\n\n<p>As an evaluation of the fitness consequences of protandry, we tested the interference-avoidance hypothesis with enclosed, artificial populations of Chamerion angustifolium (Onagraceae) by experimentally manipulating protandry and inflorescence size and measuring pollinator visitation, seed set, female outcrossing-rate, and outcross siring-success. Protandrous plants had a marginally higher female outcrossing rate than adichogamous plants, but similar seed set and visitation rates. More importantly, protandrous plants (blue points) had, on average, a twofold siring advantage relative to adichogamous plants (red points). However, this siring advantage did not increase linearly with inflorescence size, suggesting that protandry acts to enhance siring success, but not exclusively by reducing between-flower interference.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://matt.routleynet.org/uploads/2019/885b748f18.jpg\" width=\"500\" height=\"458\" alt=\"siring\"/></p>\n\n<p>To better understand the function of protandry, we analyzed single bee visits to pairs of C. angustifolium flowers in the field and the lab. The patterns of pollen removal and deposition revealed two major consequences of simultaneous hermaphroditism. First, the presence of anthers impeded pollinator‚Äôs access to the stigma. Second, pollinators spent more time foraging on hermaphroditic flowers, relative to female flowers. Protandry allows pollen to be exported in the absence of this within-flower interference and can enhance both male and female reproductive success through reductions in pollen discounting and facilitated selfing, respectively.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://matt.routleynet.org/uploads/2019/eb7545a393.jpg\" width=\"400\" height=\"299\" alt=\"beevisit\"/></p>\n\n<h2>Genetic analysis</h2>\n\n<p>The genetic basis of dichogamy may have important implications for its evolution. Consequently, we conducted genetic analyses of protandry in C. angustifolium using a paternal half-sib design and an artificial selection experiment. We found moderate heritability (h^2^=0.27) for the duration of male phase.

				"content_text": "<p>Dichogamy, the temporal separation of gender within a flower, is widespread throughout the angiosperms, occurring in over 250 families. There are two forms of dichogamy: protandry, in which male function precedes female function, and protogyny, the converse. Dichogamy has traditionally been interpreted as a mechanism to avoid inbreeding. However, recent evidence indicates that this inbreeding-avoidance hypothesis cannot completely explain the evolution of dichogamy. An alternate hypothesis is that dichogamy acts to reduce interference between gender functions. Interference can occur within a flower or between flowers on an inflorescence and result in substantial reductions in male and female reproductive success. To date there are very few tests of this interference-avoidance hypothesis or, in fact, investigations of the evolution of dichogamy in general. My Ph.D. thesis was a comprehensive evaluation of the evolutionary significance of dichogamy, including functional, genetic, comparative, and theoretical analyses of this important floral character.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://matt.routleynet.org/uploads/2019/02908cc8b7.jpg\" width=\"250\" height=\"331\" alt=\"clint\"/></p>\n\n<p>This Claytonia species is protandrous. The flower on the left is in male phase with its anthers shedding pollen and the stigma closed and unreceptive. The flower on the right is approximately one day older and is in female phase. The stigma is open and receptive and the anthers have moved away to the side and are empty of pollen.</p>\n\n<h2>Functional analyses</h2>\n\n<p>As an evaluation of the fitness consequences of protandry, we tested the interference-avoidance hypothesis with enclosed, artificial populations of Chamerion angustifolium (Onagraceae) by experimentally manipulating protandry and inflorescence size and measuring pollinator visitation, seed set, female outcrossing-rate, and outcross siring-success. Protandrous plants had a marginally higher female outcrossing rate than adichogamous plants, but similar seed set and visitation rates. More importantly, protandrous plants (blue points) had, on average, a twofold siring advantage relative to adichogamous plants (red points). However, this siring advantage did not increase linearly with inflorescence size, suggesting that protandry acts to enhance siring success, but not exclusively by reducing between-flower interference.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://matt.routleynet.org/uploads/2019/885b748f18.jpg\" width=\"500\" height=\"458\" alt=\"siring\"/></p>\n\n<p>To better understand the function of protandry, we analyzed single bee visits to pairs of C. angustifolium flowers in the field and the lab. The patterns of pollen removal and deposition revealed two major consequences of simultaneous hermaphroditism. First, the presence of anthers impeded pollinator‚Äôs access to the stigma. Second, pollinators spent more time foraging on hermaphroditic flowers, relative to female flowers. Protandry allows pollen to be exported in the absence of this within-flower interference and can enhance both male and female reproductive success through reductions in pollen discounting and facilitated selfing, respectively.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://matt.routleynet.org/uploads/2019/eb7545a393.jpg\" width=\"400\" height=\"299\" alt=\"beevisit\"/></p>\n\n<h2>Genetic analysis</h2>\n\n<p>The genetic basis of dichogamy may have important implications for its evolution. Consequently, we conducted genetic analyses of protandry in C. angustifolium using a paternal half-sib design and an artificial selection experiment. We found moderate heritability (h^2^=0.27) for the duration of male phase. An analysis of plants from the artificial selection experiment showed no genetic correlation between male-phase duration and aspects of floral size. However, we estimated a positive genetic correlation between male-phase duration and floral display size. In addition, we detected a negative correlation between male- and female-phase durations which creates the opportunity for fitness trade-offs between male and female function.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://matt.routleynet.org/uploads/2019/65f28c4282.jpg\" width=\"464\" height=\"442\" alt=\"sel\"/></p>\n\n<h2>Phylogenetic analysis</h2>\n\n<p>To gain a broader perspective on the evolution of dichogamy, we used a current, well resolved phylogeny of the angiosperms to conduct a comparative analysis of dichogamy and self-incompatibility.
