  <p>&#8230; in Saskatoon today, Bay Street investors and a group of chiefs from Saskatchewan and Alberta will formally announce the unlikeliest of marriages, one that will make them the most influential farmers in all of Canada, with a super-sized one-million-acre operation that could rival the largest corporate farms in the world.</p>
  
  <p>Under the plan, 17 native bands will lease their land at market value to a new entity called One Earth Farms Corporation, which will focus on sustainable, environmentally responsible land use, hire and train aboriginal workers, and provide first nations an equity stake in the company.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is an interesting initiative and worth tracking &#8212; not because of the massive size of the project. Rather, the partnership between bands and investors is novel.</p></div>

        <h1>Goodyear&#039;s Religious Beliefs vs. Evolution</h1><div><p>Our minister of science continues to argue that his unwillingness to endorse the theory of evolution is not relevant to science policy. As quoted by the <a href="http://www.theglobeandmail.com/servlet/story/RTGAM.20090318.wgoodyear0318/BNStory/politics/home">Globe and Mail</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>My view isn&#8217;t important. My personal beliefs are not important.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I find this amazing. How can the minister of science&#8217;s views on the fundamental unifying theory of biology not be important?</p>

<p>I don&#8217;t expect him to understand the details of evolutionary theory or to have all of his personal beliefs vetted and religious views muted. However, I do expect him &#8212; as minister &#8212; to champion and support Canadian science, especially basic research. When our minister refuses to acknowledge the fundamental discoveries of science, our reputation is diminished.</p>

<p>There is also a legitimate &#8212; though rather exaggerated &#8212; concern that the minister&#8217;s views on the truth can influence policy and funding decisions. The funding councils are more than sufficiently independent to prevent any undue ministerial influence here. The real problem is an apparent distrust or lack of interest in basic research from the federal government.</p></div>

<p>His main point is certainly right: we can&#8217;t have the many benefits of energy without consequence and the National Geographic neglected to show these benefits. However, I do think that Canadians need to be aware of the trade-offs we are making and mitigate &#8212; to the extent possible &#8212; threats to our environment. For most of us, energy just appears when we flip a switch or drive to the gas station.</p>

<p>I think the tar sands are an important Canadian resource and with careful stewardship their benefits could far exceed their costs. However, my sense is that current policies are not focussed on stewardship and we risk squandering the opportunities provided by the tar sands.</p></div>

  <p>But here&#8217;s a surprise for Stephen Harper. We&#8217;re calling your bluff. This time we&#8217;re telling Ottawa: not so fast. Lots of Canadians are prepared to risk prosecution and defy the ban on funding Abdelrazik. Through an explicit civil disobedience project called Operation Fly Home, spearheaded by Mary Foster in Montreal, a first group of 115 Canadians have so far donated small sums to buy his air ticket home. All of us are making our names and addresses public, so the Mounties won&#8217;t have trouble finding us. Our crime? Paying $20 dollars or so to bring home a stranded fellow Canadian whose only crime is his name and religion.</p>

  <p>&#8220;Death by hyperthermia&#8221; is the official designation.

It happens that way somewhere in the United States 15 to 25 times a year, parceled out through the spring, summer and early fall. The season is almost upon us.</p>
