<blockquote>
  <p>This, in brief, is the bad news: the food and agriculture policies you’ve inherited — designed to maximize production at all costs and relying on cheap energy to do so — are in shambles, and the need to address the problems they have caused is acute. The good news is that the twinned crises in food and energy are creating a political environment in which real reform of the food system may actually be possible for the first time in a generation.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The core of his solution is:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>&#8230; we need to wean the American food system off its heavy 20th-century diet of fossil fuel and put it back on a diet of contemporary sunshine</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>For us the world is vastly simpler in some sense than the academy, vastly more complicated in another. So the central lesson from decision-making (as opposed to working with data on a computer or bickering about logical constructions) is the following: it is the exposure (or payoff) that creates the complexity —and the opportunities and dangers— not so much the knowledge ( i.e., statistical distribution, model representation, etc.). In some situations, you can be extremely wrong and be fine, in others you can be slightly wrong and explode. If you are leveraged, errors blow you up; if you are not, you can enjoy life.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Living without God isn&#8217;t easy. But its very difficulty offers one other consolation—that there is a certain honor, or perhaps just a grim satisfaction, in facing up to our condition without despair and without wishful thinking—with good humor, but without God.</p>

        <h1>Globe and Mail: Incremental man</h1><div><p>A <a href="http://www.theglobeandmail.com/servlet/story/RTGAM.20081004.whapercover04/BNStory/politics/home?pageRequested=all">detailed and fascinating portrait of Stephen Harper</a>. As the article points out:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The core of any government reflects the personality of the prime minister, because everyone in the system responds to his or her ways of thinking, personality traits, political ambitions and policy preferences. Know the prime minister; know the government.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Harper has been an enigma and learning more about his personal policies and approach to governance is very useful while thinking about the upcoming election.</p>

<p>A general summary of the article comes from near the end:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>And the long-distance runner – bright, intense, strategic, cautious and confident in every stride – has certainly got things done, from merging two parties, to winning a minority government, to fulfilling most of his campaign promises.</p>
  
  <p>He also has pursued two broad changes in the nature of the federal government: giving the provinces more running room by keeping Ottawa out of some of their affairs and giving individuals a bit more money in the form of tax reductions, credits and child-care cheques.</p>
  
  <p>And yet, despite these policies that he assumed would be popular, despite all the problems on the Liberal side, despite raising far more money, despite governing in mostly excellent economic times, despite stroking Quebec, despite gearing up for elections, his Conservatives have yet to break through decisively.</p>
