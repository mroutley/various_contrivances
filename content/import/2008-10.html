<blockquote>
  <p>This, in brief, is the bad news: the food and agriculture policies you’ve inherited — designed to maximize production at all costs and relying on cheap energy to do so — are in shambles, and the need to address the problems they have caused is acute. The good news is that the twinned crises in food and energy are creating a political environment in which real reform of the food system may actually be possible for the first time in a generation.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The core of his solution is:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>&#8230; we need to wean the American food system off its heavy 20th-century diet of fossil fuel and put it back on a diet of contemporary sunshine</p>

        <h1>Election 2008</h1><div><p>Like most Canadians, I&#8217;ll be at the polls today for the 2008 Federal Election.</p>

<p>In the past several elections, I&#8217;ve cast my vote for the party with the best climate change plan.  The <a href="http://econ-environment.ca/" title="An Open Letter to the Leaders of Canadas Federal Political Parties">consensus among economists</a> is that any credible plan must set a price on carbon emissions. My personal preference is for a predictable and transparent price to influence consumer spending, so I favour a carbon tax over a cap-and-trade. Enlightening discussions of these issues are available at <a href="http://worthwhile.typepad.com/worthwhile_canadian_initi/environment/" title="Worthwhile Canadian Initiative: Environment">Worthwhile Canadian Initiative</a>, <a href="http://www.theglobeandmail.com/opinions/columnists/Jeffrey+Simpson.html" title="globeandmail.com: Opinions - Jeffrey Simpson">Jeffrey Simpson&#8217;s column</a> at the Globe and Mail, or his book <a href="http://www.amazon.ca/gp/product/0771080972?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=matthewroutle-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=15121&amp;creative=330641&amp;creativeASIN=0771080972">Hot Air</a><img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.ca/e/ir?t=matthewroutle-20&amp;l=as2&amp;o=15&amp;a=0771080972" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;"/>.</p>

<p>Until now this voting principle has meant a vote for the <a href="http://www.greenparty.ca/">Green Party</a> who support a tax shift from income to pollution. My expectation for this vote was not that the Green Party would gain any direct political power, rather their environmental plan would gain political profile and convince the Liberals and Conservatives to improve their plans. A carbon tax is now a central component of this year&#8217;s <a href="http://www.liberal.ca/platform_e.aspx" title="Liberal.ca :: Richer, Fairer, Greener : An Action Plan for the 21st Century">Liberal Platform</a> with the <a href="http://www.thegreenshift.ca/default_e.aspx" title="thegreenshift.ca">Green Shift</a>. Both the <a href="http://www.conservative.ca/EN/4739/78192">Conservative Pary</a> and <a href="http://www.ndp.ca/platform/environment/" title="A Plan for the Environment That Will Really Work | NDP">NDP</a> support a limited cap-and-trade system on portions of the economy, with the Conservatives supporting dubious &#8220;intensity-based&#8221; targets.</p>

<p>Although I quite like the central components of the Green Shift, I&#8217;m not too keen on the distracting social engineering aspects of the plan. Furthermore, the Liberals have certainly failed to implement any of their previous climate change plans while in power. Nonetheless, I do think (hope?) they will follow through this time and I prefer supporting a well-conceived plan that may not be implemented than a poor plan. Despite my support for this plan, I think the Liberals have done a rather poor job of explaining the Green Shift and have conducted a disappointing campaign.</p>

<p>In the end, my principle will hold. I&#8217;m voting for the Green Shift and, reluctantly, the Liberal Party of Canada.</p></div>

<blockquote>
  <p>For us the world is vastly simpler in some sense than the academy, vastly more complicated in another. So the central lesson from decision-making (as opposed to working with data on a computer or bickering about logical constructions) is the following: it is the exposure (or payoff) that creates the complexity —and the opportunities and dangers— not so much the knowledge ( i.e., statistical distribution, model representation, etc.). In some situations, you can be extremely wrong and be fine, in others you can be slightly wrong and explode. If you are leveraged, errors blow you up; if you are not, you can enjoy life.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Living without God isn&#8217;t easy. But its very difficulty offers one other consolation—that there is a certain honor, or perhaps just a grim satisfaction, in facing up to our condition without despair and without wishful thinking—with good humor, but without God.</p>

        <h1>Globe and Mail: Incremental man</h1><div><p>A <a href="http://www.theglobeandmail.com/servlet/story/RTGAM.20081004.whapercover04/BNStory/politics/home?pageRequested=all">detailed and fascinating portrait of Stephen Harper</a>. As the article points out:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The core of any government reflects the personality of the prime minister, because everyone in the system responds to his or her ways of thinking, personality traits, political ambitions and policy preferences. Know the prime minister; know the government.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Harper has been an enigma and learning more about his personal policies and approach to governance is very useful while thinking about the upcoming election.</p>

<p>A general summary of the article comes from near the end:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>And the long-distance runner – bright, intense, strategic, cautious and confident in every stride – has certainly got things done, from merging two parties, to winning a minority government, to fulfilling most of his campaign promises.</p>
  
  <p>He also has pursued two broad changes in the nature of the federal government: giving the provinces more running room by keeping Ottawa out of some of their affairs and giving individuals a bit more money in the form of tax reductions, credits and child-care cheques.</p>
  
  <p>And yet, despite these policies that he assumed would be popular, despite all the problems on the Liberal side, despite raising far more money, despite governing in mostly excellent economic times, despite stroking Quebec, despite gearing up for elections, his Conservatives have yet to break through decisively.</p>
