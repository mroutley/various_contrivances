  <p>My research compared the achievements of Canadian public service and political leaders with their U.K. counterparts, and the results are very favourable to Canada. It was rewarding to hear so many U.K. public service leaders ask about Canadian reforms. It seems that public service managers around the world are looking carefully at leading practices emerging in Ottawa and the provinces, especially Ontario.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>One of the strange challenges I have as a public servant is the constant description of my colleagues as overpaid and underworked. The classic quote came from John Tory as leader of Ontario&#8217;s opposition party:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“These kinds of jobs are people who are breathing each other’s exhaust and sitting around, analyzing each other’s papers. There hasn’t been enough attention paid to looking at whether those people are really making a productive contribution to the effective delivery of public services in Ontario.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Of course, you can point to several studies showing how efficient Ontario&#8217;s public servants are and how much the <a href="http://growinggap.ca/campaigns/public_spending">public benefits</a> from government services, but people aren&#8217;t interested in reviewing this kind of evidence. So, I&#8217;m happy to see Tony Dean advocating for public servants. I think that strong advocacy from public servant leaders will help much more than statistics.</p></div>

I had looked into using the Bettencourt paper (cited in this article) for making allocation decisions. The trick is moving from the general patterns observed in urban scaling to specific recommendations for where to invest in new infrastructure. This is particularly challenging in the absence of good, detailed data on the current infrastructure stock. We&#8217;ve made good progress on gathering some of this data, and it might be worth revisiting this scaling relationship.</p></div>

        <h1>Mama Earth Organics</h1><div><p>I&#8217;m certain that paying attention to where my food comes from is important. Food production influences my health, has environmental consequences, and affects both urban and rural design. Ideally, I would develop relationships with local farmers, carefully choose organic produce, and always consider broad environmental impacts. Except, I like to spend time with my young family, try to get some exercise, and have more than enough commitments through work to actually spend this much effort on food choices. So, I&#8217;ve outsourced this process to the excellent <a href="http://www.mamaearth.ca/">Mama Earth Organics</a>.</p>

<p>Every week a basket of fresh organic and/or local fruit and vegetables arrives on our doorstep. Part of the fun of this service is that different items arrive each week, which diversifies our weekly food routine. But, we always know what&#8217;s coming several days in advance, so we can plan our meals well ahead of time. After over a year of service, we&#8217;ve only had a single complaint about quality and this was handled very quickly by Mama Earth with a full refund plus credit.</p>

<p>We&#8217;ve found the small basket is sufficient for two adults and a picky four-year old. We&#8217;ve also added in some fresh bread from St. John&#8217;s Bakery, which has been consistently delicious and lasts through most of the week.</p></div>

        <div class="quote">&ldquo;Commercial air travel, like many other industries, is lubricated by cheap oil. Mr. Rubin, the former chief economist of CIBC World Markets, has now bet his career on a single idea – that the cheap oil era is dead and globalization is about to wither along with it. But the most fascinating part of his thesis has nothing to do with geology or Hubbert&#8217;s peak oil theory. It&#8217;s about the reindustrialization of North America. Those unemployed airline workers could be looking for work – and finding it – in the revitalized factories of Southern Ontario.&rdquo;</div><div>&mdash; <a href="http://beta.theglobeandmail.com/globe-investor/energy-carbon-taxes-and-the-winds-of-change/article1141534/">Energy, carbon taxes and the winds of change - The Globe and Mail</a></div>
