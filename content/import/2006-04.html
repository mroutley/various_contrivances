        <h1>Google calendar</h1><div><p><a href="http://calendar.google.com">Google Calendar</a> has been featured in the news recently, and for good reason. Many of us have wanted access to a good online calendar program. One of my favourite features of Google Calendar is its integration with <a href="http://mail.google.com">Gmail</a>. If Gmail detects an event in your email message, a link appears that sends the information to Google Calendar. This is incredibly convenient and, seems to me, is one of the great promises of computers: reducing the tedious work that occupies much of our day.</p></div>

        <h1>Analysis of Count Data</h1><div><p>When response variables are composed of counts, the standard statistical methods that rely on the normal distribution are no longer applicable. Count data are comprised of positive integers and, often, many zeros. For such data, we need statistics based on Poisson or binomial distributions. I’ve spent the past few weeks analysing counts from hundreds of transects and, as is typical, a particular challenge was determining the appropriate packages to use for <a href="http://wwww.r-project.org/">R</a>. Here’s what I’ve found so far.</p>

<p>The first step is to get an idea of the dispersion of data points:</p>

<pre><code>  Means &lt;- tapply(y, list(x1, x2), mean)
 Vars &lt;- tapply(y, list(x1, x2), var)
 plot(Means, Vars, xlab="Means", ylab="Variances")
 abline(a=0, b=1)
</code></pre>

<p>For the Poisson distribution, the mean is equal to the variance. So, we expect the points to lie along the solid line added to the plot. If the points are overdispersed, a negative binomial link function may be more appropriate. The <code>pscl</code> library provides a function to test this:</p>

<pre><code>  library(pscl)
 model.nb &lt;- glm.nb(y ~ x, data=data)
 odTest(model.nb)
 summary(model.nb)
</code></pre>

<p>If the <code>odTest</code> function rejects the null model, then the data are overdispersed relative to a Poisson distribution. One particularly useful function is <code>glmmPQL</code> from the <code>MASS</code> library. This function allows for random intercepts and combined with the negative.binomial function of the same library, you can fit a negative binomial GLMM:</p>

<pre><code>  model.glmm.nb &lt;- glmmPQL(y ~ x1 + x2,
     random= ~ 1|transect, data=data,
     family=negative.binomial(model.nb$theta))
</code></pre>

<p>In this case, I use the Θ estimated from the <code>glm.nb</code> function in the <code>negative.binomial</code> call. Also useful are the <code>zeroinfl</code> function of the <code>pscl</code> library for fitting zero-inflated Poisson or negative binomial models and the <code>geeglm</code> function of <code>geepack</code> for fitting generalized estimating equations for repeated measures. Finally, <code>fitdistr</code> from <code>MASS</code> allows for estimating the parameters of different distributions from empirical data.</p></div>

        <h1>Getting Evolution Up to Speed</h1><div><p>There&#8217;s a common notion that our technology has slowed, or even stopped, human evolution. Evidently, this is not true as researchers have found many locations of strong positive selection in the human genome.</p>

<p>bq. New evidence suggests humans are evolving more rapidly &#8212; and more recently &#8212; than most people thought possible. But for some radical evolutionists, Homo sapiens isn&#8217;t morphing quickly enough.</p>

        <h1>SSHRC and the theory of evolution</h1><div><p>This is quite a surprise, McGill University’s Brian Alters had his proposal to study the effects of intelligent design on Canadian education rejected by the Canadian <a href="http://www.sshrc-crsh.gc.ca/web/home_e.asp">Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council</a>. A stated reason for the rejection was that Alters did not provide “adequate justification for the assumption in the proposal that the theory of evolution, and not intelligent design theory, was correct.”</p>

<p>Granted, funding proposals can be rejected for a variety of reasons and the opinions of the reviewers do not necessarily reflect those of the funding body. However, the international media (Nature, The Guardian) are reporting on this and the suggestion is that the Canadian Government — or, at least, our funding agency for social science research — rejects evolution.</p>

<p>If SSHRC intends to pass judgement on scientific theories, they should review the evidence first. Biological evolution is a fact. Furthermore, the theory of evolution through natural selection has accumulated 150 years of empirical evidence and ranks as one of science’s greatest insights.</p>

<p>I hope that SSHRC clarifies their position on evolution soon.</p>

        <h1>Deschooling, Democratic Education, and Social Change</h1><div><p>Matt Hern provides an <a href="http://canadianvoices.org/speakers.php?id=19">interesting podcast</a> available from <a href="http://canadianvoices.org/">Canadian Voices</a>. He considers the 150 year history of compulsory state education and asks what benefits it has provided. The basic question is, Why do we send our kids to school? Although the answer seems obvious, he takes a different approach and argues for alternatives to public education. I’m always fascinated when someone argues against what I believe to be obvious. That’s when I learn the most about my biases.</p></div>

        <h1>Desktop Manager</h1><div><p>I’m convinced that no computer display is large enough. What we need are strategies to better manage our computer workspace and application windows. <a href="http://www.apple.com/macosx/features/expose/">Exposé</a> and <a href="http://www.caminobrowser.org/images/screenshots/main_window.jpg">tabbed browsing</a> are great features, but what I really want is the equivalent of a file folder. You put all of the relevant documents in a folder and then put it aside for when you need it. Once you’re ready, you open up the folder and are ready to go.</p>

<p>A feature that comes close to this is virtual desktops. I became enamoured with these while running <a href="http://www.kde.org/">KDE</a> and have found them again for OS X with <a href="http://desktopmanager.berlios.de/">Desktop Manager</a>. The idea is to create workspaces associated with specific tasks as a virtual desktop. You can then switch between these desktops as you move from one project to the next. So, for each of the projects I am currently working on, I’ve created a desktop with each application’s windows in the appropriate place. For a consulting project, I likely have <a href="http://aquamacs.org/">Aquamacs</a> running an R simulation with a terminal window open for updating my subversion repository. A project in the writing stage requires <a href="http://www.uoregon.edu/~koch/texshop/">TeXShop</a> and <a href="http://bibdesk.sourceforge.net/">BibDesk</a>, while a web-design project needs <a href="http://macromates.com/">TextMate</a> and <a href="http://www.caminobrowser.org/">Camino</a>. Each of these workspaces is independent and I can quickly switch to them when needed. Since the applications are running with their windows in the appropriate place, I can quickly get back to work on the project at hand.</p>

<p>Application windows can be split across desktops and specific windows can be present across all desktops. I’ve also found it useful to have one desktop for communication (email, messaging, etc.) and another that has no windows open at all.</p></div>
