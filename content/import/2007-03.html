        <h1>Creationists and their old tricks</h1><div><p>TVO&#8217;s The Agenda had an interesting <a href="http://www.tvo.org/cfmx/tvoorg/theagenda/index.cfm?page_id=7&amp;bpn=379035&amp;ts=2007-03-27%2020:00:00.0">show</a> on the debate between evolutionary biology and creationism. <a href="http://pondside.uchicago.edu/ecol-evol/faculty/coyne_j.html">Jerry Coyne</a> provided a great overview of evolution and a good defence during the debate.</p>

<p>The debate offered a great illustration of the intellectual vacuity that characterises creationism (aka intelligent design). Paul Nelson offers up an <a href="http://www.pnas.org/cgi/content/abstract/104/7/2043">article</a> by Doolittle and Bapteste as proof that Darwinism is unravelling. I suspect he hopes no one will read past the abstract to discover the reasonable debate scientists are having about the universality of a single tree of life. He certainly doesn&#8217;t want you to notice that the entire article is couched within evolutionary theory and not once does it claim that Darwinism has been falsified.</p>

<p>Here&#8217;s the hypothesis that Doolittle and Bapteste are evaluating:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>&#8220;that there should be a universal TOL [tree of life], dichotomously branching all of the way down to a single root.&#8221; p2045</p>
</blockquote>

<p>They then establish that gene transfer often occurs between lineages, particularly among prokaryotes, and consequently this universal tree of life does not exist. Certainly this complicates the construction of molecular trees and shows the importance for pluralism of mechanism in biology. But they write much more about the overall significance of this work.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>&#8220;To be sure, much of evolution has been tree-like and is captured in hierarchical classifications.&#8221; p2048</p>
  
  <p>&#8220;&#8230;it would be perverse to claim that Darwin’s TOL hypothesis has been falsified for animals (the taxon to which he primarily addressed himself) or that it is not an appropriate model for many taxa at many levels of analysis&#8221; p2048</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And the crucial quote in this context:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>&#8220;Holding onto this ladder of pattern [&#8230;] should not be an essential element in our struggle against those who doubt the validity of evolutionary theory, who can take comfort from this challenge to the TOL only by a willful misunderstanding of its import.&#8221; p2048</p>

        <h1>Stikkit from the command line</h1><div><p>Note – This post has been updated from 2007-03-20 to describe new installation instructions.</p>

<h2>Overview</h2>

<p>I’ve integrated <a href="http://www.stikkit.com/">Stikkit</a> into most of my workflow and am quite happy with the results. However, one missing piece is quick access to Stikkit from the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command_line_interface">command line</a>. In particular, a quick list of my undone todos is quite useful without having to load up a web browser.
To this end, I’ve written a <a href="http://www.ruby-lang.org/">Ruby</a> script for interacting with Stikkit. As I mentioned, my real interest is in listing undone todos. But I decided to make the script more general, so you can ask for specific types of stikkits and restrict the stikkits with specific parameters. Also, since the <a href="http://www.stikkit.com/api">stikkit api</a> is so easy to use, I added in a method for creating new stikkits.</p>

<h2>Usage</h2>

<p>The general use of the script is to list stikkits of a particular type, filtered by a parameter. For example,</p>

<pre><code>ruby stikkit.rb --list calendar dates=today</code></pre>

<p>will show all of today’s calendar events. While,</p>

<pre><code>ruby stikkit.rb -l todos done=0</code></pre>

<p>lists all undone todos. The use of -l instead of <code>--list</code> is simply a standard convenience. Furthermore, since this last example comprises almost all of my use for this script, I added a convenience method to get all undone todos</p>

<pre><code>ruby stikkit.rb -t</code></pre>

<p>A good way to understand stikkit types and parameters is to keep an eye on the url while you interact with Stikkit in your browser.
To create a new stikkit, use the <code>--create</code> flag,</p>

<pre><code>ruby stikkit.rb -c 'Remember me.'</code></pre>

<p>The text you pass to stikkit.rb will be processed as usual by Stikkit.</p>

<h2>Installation</h2>

<p>Grab the script from the <a href="http://code.google.com/p/stikkit-rb/">Google Code project</a> and put it somewhere convenient. Making the file executable and adding it to your path will cut down on the typing. The script reads from a .stikkit file in your path that contains your username and password. Modify this template and save it as ~/.sikkit</p>

<pre><code>
     ---
     username: me@domain.org 
     password: superSecret 
</code></pre>

<p>The script also requires the <a href="http://split-s.blogspot.com/2006/04/atom-10-parser-for-ruby.html">atom gem</a>, which you can grab with</p>

<pre><code>gem install atom</code></pre>

<p>I’ve tried to include some flexibility in the processing of stikkits. So, if you don’t like using <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atom">atom</a>, you can switch to a different <a href="http://stikkit.com/api#responses">format</a> provided by Stikkit. The text type requires no gems, but makes picking out pieces of the stikkits challenging.</p>

<h2>Feedback</h2>

<p>This script serves me well, but I’m interested in making it more useful. Feel free to pass along any comments or feature requests.</p></div>

        <h1>Yahoo Pipes and the Globe and Mail</h1><div><p>Most of my updates arrive through <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_feed">feeds</a> to <a href="http://www.newsgator.com/NGOLProduct.aspx?ProdID=NetNewsWire">NetNewsWire</a>. Since my main source of national news and analysis is the <a href="http://www.theglobeandmail.com/">Globe and Mail</a>, I&#8217;m quite happy that they provide <a href="http://www.theglobeandmail.com/rss/">many feeds</a> for accessing their content. The problem is that many news stories are duplicated across these feeds. Furthermore, tracking all of the feeds of interest is challenging.</p>

<p>The new <a href="http://pipes.yahoo.com/">Yahoo Pipes</a> offer a solution to these problems. Without providing too much detail, pipes are a way to filter, connect, and generally mash-up the web with a straightforward interface. I&#8217;ve used this service to collect all of the Globe and Mail feeds of interest, filter out the duplicates, and produce a feed I can subscribe to. Nothing fancy, but quite useful. <a href="http://pipes.yahoo.com/pipes/pipe.info?_id=YjZyKsHM2xGr3_z5l7okhQ">The pipe</a> is publicly available and if you don&#8217;t agree with my choice of news feeds, you are free to clone mine and create your own. There are plenty of other pipes available, so take a look to see if anything looks useful to you. Even better, create your own.</p>

<p>If you really want those details, Tim O&#8217;Reilly <a href="http://radar.oreilly.com/archives/2007/02/pipes_and_filte.html">has plenty</a>.</p></div>

        <h1>Stikkit Todos in GMail</h1><div><p>I find it useful to have a list of my unfinished tasks generally, but subtley, available. To this end, I&#8217;ve added my unfinished todos from <a href="http://stikkit.com/">Stikkit</a> to my <a href="http://mail.google.com/mail/">Gmail</a> web clips. These are the small snippets of text that appear just above the message list in GMail.</p>

<p>All you need is the subscribe link from your todo page with the &#8216;not done&#8217; button toggled. The url should look something like:</p>

<pre><code><a href="http://stikkit.com/todos.atom?api_key=%7B%7D&amp;done=0">http://stikkit.com/todos.atom?api_key={}&amp;done=0</a>
</code></pre>

<p>Paste this into the &#8216;Search by topic or URL:&#8217; box of Web Clips tab in GMail settings.</p></div>
