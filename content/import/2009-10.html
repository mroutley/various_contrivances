If they don&#8217;t fall into one of the risk groups, they will be weeded out. The Public Health Agency of Canada, and other health authorities, along with their political masters, should not be surprised by the resulting public fury.&rdquo;</div><div>&mdash; <a href="http://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/national/weeding-out-the-queue/article1346686/">Weeding out the queue</a> (via <a href="http://www.instapaper.com/">Instapaper</a>)</div>

        <div class="quote">&ldquo;Looking back over human history, rationality has been the anomaly. Being rational takes work, education, and a sober determination to avoid making hasty inferences, even when they appear to make perfect sense. Much like infectious diseases themselves — beaten back by decades of effort to vaccinate the populace — the irrational lingers just below the surface, waiting for us to let down our guard.&rdquo;</div><div>&mdash; <a href="http://www.wired.com/magazine/2009/10/ff_waronscience/all/1">Wired: ‘An Epidemic of Fear: How Panicked Parents Skipping Shots Endangers Us All’</a> (via <a href="http://www.instapaper.com/">Instapaper</a>)</div>

        <div class="quote">&ldquo;A vast majority of professionals are in “emergency scanning” mode. Their self-management consists of checking for and acting on the loudest immediacies – in email, in the hallways and on the phone. Everything else is shoved to the side of the desk, and to the back of their mind. Because they’re focused only on “priorities”, and are paying attention only to the most intheir- face stuff, everyone else has to raise the noise level to “emergency” mode to get any audience at all. Sensitivity and responsiveness to input are criteria for the evolution of a species; and many an organisation has a nervous system that keeps them low on the food chain.&rdquo;</div><div>&mdash; <a href="http://www.wired.co.uk/wired-magazine/archive/2009/08/how-to/david-allen.aspx">David Allen on setting priorities</a> (via <a href="http://www.instapaper.com/">Instapaper</a>)</div>

        <h1>Emacs Installation on Windows XP</h1><div><p>I spend a fair bit of time with a locked-down Windows XP machine. Fortunately, I&#8217;m able to install Emacs which provides capabilities that I find quite helpful. I&#8217;ve had to reinstall Emacs a few times now. So, for my own benefit (and perhaps your&#8217;s) here are the steps I follow:</p>

<ol>
<li>
<p>Download EmacsW32 patched and install in my user directory under Apps</p>

<p>Available from <a href="http://ourcomments.org/Emacs/EmacsW32.html">http://ourcomments.org/Emacs/EmacsW32.html</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Set the environment variable for HOME to my user directory</p>

<p>Right click on My Computer, select the Advanced tab, and then Environment Variables.</p>

<p>Add a new variable and set Variable name to HOME and Variable value to C:\Documents and Settings\my_user_directory</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Download technomancy&#8217;s Emacs Starter Kit</p>

<p>Available from <a href="http://github.com/technomancy/emacs-starter-kit">http://github.com/technomancy/emacs-starter-kit</a></p>

<p>Extract archive into .emacs_d in %HOME%</p>

<p>Copy my specific emacs settings into .emacs_d\my_user_name.el</p>
</li>
