Sentences</a>
by Don Watson is a wonderful book &#8212; simultaneously funny, scary, and
inspiring &#8212; that describes how &#8220;clich√©s, weasel words, and
management-speak&#8221; are infecting public language.</p>

<p>The humour comes from Watson&#8217;s acerbic commentary and fantastic scorn
for phrases like:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Given the within year and budget time flexibility accorded to the
  science agencies in the determination of resource allocation from
  within their global budget, a multi-parameter approach to
  maintaining the agencies budgets in real terms is not appropriate.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The book is scary because it makes a strong argument for the dangers
of this type of language.  Citizens become confused and disinterested,
customers become jaded, and people loose their love for language.
Also, as a public servant I see this kind of language every day and
often find myself struggling to avoid banality and cliches (not to
mention bullet points).  We need more forceful advocates like Don
Watson to call out politicians and corporations for abusing our
language.  This book certainly makes me want to try harder.  And
what&#8217;s more inspiring than struggling for a good cause against long
odds?</p>

<p>The book also has a great glossary of typical weasel words with possible synonyms. So, I&#8217;m keeping the book in my office for quick reference.</p></div>

        <h1>Omnivore</h1><div><p>After seventeen years as a vegetarian, I recently switched back to an
omnivore. My motivation for not eating meat was environmental, since,
on average, a vegetarian diet requires much less land, water, and
energy.  This is still the right motivation, but over the last year or
so I&#8217;ve been rethinking my decision to not eat meat.</p>

<p>My concern was that I&#8217;d stopped paying attention to my food choices
and a poorly considered vegetarian diet can easily yield a bad
environmental outcome.  In particular, modern agriculture now takes
<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/10/12/magazine/12policy-t.html?_r=2&amp;pagewanted=all">10 calories of fossil fuel energy to produce a single calorie of
food</a>.  This is clearly unsustainable.  We cannot rely on
non-renewable, polluting resources for our food, nor can we continue
to transport food great distances &#8212; even if it is only vegetables.
My unexamined commitment to a vegetarian diet was no longer consistent
with environmental sustainability.</p>

<p>I think the solution is to eat local, organic food.  This also
requires eating seasonal food, but Canadian winters are horrible for
local vegetables.  This left me wanting to support local agriculture,
but unable to restrict my diet.  Returning to my original motivation
to choose environmentally appropriate food convinced me it was time to
return to being an omnivore. My new policy is to follow Michael
Pollan&#8217;s advice: &#8220;Eat food. Mostly plants. Not too much.&#8221;  In
addition, I&#8217;ll favour locally grown, organic food and include small
amounts of meat &#8212; which I hope will predominantly come from carefully
considered and sustainable sources.  I&#8217;ve also deciced that when faced
with a dillema of choosing either local or organic, I&#8217;ll choose local.
We need to support local agriculture and I&#8217;ll trade this for organic
if necessary.  Of course, in the majority of cases local and organic
options are available, and I&#8217;ll choose them.</p>

<p>This is a big change and I look forward to exploring food again.</p></div>

At the least, violating basic assumptions is a useful mental exercise, but a surprising number of the resulting concepts have provided useful descriptions of the real world.</p>
