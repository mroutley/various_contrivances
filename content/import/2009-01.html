Perhaps the craziest idea yet is Saudi Arabian wheat. Some 30 years ago, the lake- and river-less kingdom decided it should be self-sufficient in wheat.</p>

<p>It worked. But the subsidies to farmers at times approached $1,000 (U.S.) a tonne. Last year, the Saudis finally concluded that desert wheat made no more sense than Nunavut pineapples. The farms will disappear within a few years, after which the country will be entirely dependent on imports. But from where?</p>

<p>Answer: from any nation willing to sell or lease vast tracts of its farmland and-here&#8217;s the kicker-allow the Saudis to export most or all of the food grown there back home, bypassing the international market. Such &#8220;offshore farms&#8221; are a quiet, though burgeoning, form of neo-colonialism. And they have the potential to unleash a new food crisis.</p>&rdquo;</div><div>&mdash; <a href="http://www.theglobeandmail.com/servlet/story/LAC.20090130.ROB2PG16/TPStory/Business/columnists">reportonbusiness.com: The farms race</a></div>

        <div class="quote">&ldquo;No one is suggesting Darwinism has all the answers to social questions. Indeed, with some, such as the role of hierarchies, it suggests there is no definitive answer at all—itself an important conclusion. What is extraordinary, though, is how rarely an evolutionary analysis is part of the process of policymaking. To draw an analogy, it is like trying to fix a car without properly understanding how it works: not impossible, but as likely as not to result in a breakdown or a crash. Perhaps, after a century and a half, it is time not just to recognise but also to understand that human beings are evolved creatures. To know thyself is, after all, the beginning of wisdom.&rdquo;</div><div>&mdash; <a href="http://www.economist.com/science/displaystory.cfm?story_id=12795581">Darwinian answers to social questions | Why we are, as we are  | The Economist</a></div>

        <h1>Instapaper Review</h1><div><p><a href="http://www.instapaper.com/iphone">Instapaper</a> is an integral part of my web-reading routine. Typically, I have a few minutes early in the morning and scattered throughout the day for quick scans of my favourite web sites and news feeds. I capture anything worth reading with Instapaper&#8217;s bookmarklet to create a reading queue of interesting articles. Then with a quick update to the <a href="http://www.instapaper.com/iphone">iPhone app</a> this queue is available whenever I find longer blocks of time for reading, particularly during the morning subway ride to work or late at night.</p>

<p>I also greatly appreciate Instapaper&#8217;s text view, which removes all the banners, ads, and link lists from the articles to present a nice and clean text view of the content only. I often find myself saving an article to Instapaper even when I have the time to read it, just so I can use this text-only view.</p>

<p>Instapaper is one of my favourite tools and the first iPhone application I purchased.</p></div>
