Perhaps the craziest idea yet is Saudi Arabian wheat. Some 30 years ago, the lake- and river-less kingdom decided it should be self-sufficient in wheat.</p>

<p>It worked. But the subsidies to farmers at times approached $1,000 (U.S.) a tonne. Last year, the Saudis finally concluded that desert wheat made no more sense than Nunavut pineapples. The farms will disappear within a few years, after which the country will be entirely dependent on imports. But from where?</p>

<p>Answer: from any nation willing to sell or lease vast tracts of its farmland and-here&#8217;s the kicker-allow the Saudis to export most or all of the food grown there back home, bypassing the international market. Such &#8220;offshore farms&#8221; are a quiet, though burgeoning, form of neo-colonialism. And they have the potential to unleash a new food crisis.</p>&rdquo;</div><div>&mdash; <a href="http://www.theglobeandmail.com/servlet/story/LAC.20090130.ROB2PG16/TPStory/Business/columnists">reportonbusiness.com: The farms race</a></div>
