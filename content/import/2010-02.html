        <div class="quote">&ldquo;Science is not a cold body of facts, but an organized system of inquiry, discovery, evaluation and learning. Science not only welcomes the correction of errors, its key attribute is that it is self-correcting over time. As new research arises, old hypotheses gain or lose support. While this process never stops, generally accepted conclusions do accumulate, based on the overwhelming weight of evidence. The fact and threat of anthropogenic climate change are clearly among those conclusions.&rdquo;</div><div>&mdash; <a href="http://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/opinions/your-square-jawed-hero-is-in-fact-the-scientist/article1461995/">Your square-jawed hero is, in fact, the scientist - The Globe and Mail</a></div>

        <div class="quote">&ldquo;It is time, finally, to learn from our mistakes. While global leaders focused single-mindedly on cutting fossil fuel use by promising to cut carbon emissions, they have failed to invest anywhere enough money into ensuring that alternative technologies are ready to take up the slack. Keep in mind that global energy demand will double by 2050. Based on our current progress, it is clear that alternative technologies will not be ready to play a significant role.&rdquo;</div><div>&mdash; <a href="http://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/opinions/climate-strategy-on-a-road-to-nowhere/article1458191/">Climate strategy on a road to nowhere - The Globe and Mail</a></div>

The 21st century is going to be the most dangerous and the most complicated (and the most exciting and dynamic) century in the history of the human race.
