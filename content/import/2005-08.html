        <h1>The Onion on Intelligent Falling theory</h1><div><p><a href="http://www.boingboing.net/2005/08/18/the_onion_on_intelli.html">The Onion on Intelligent Falling theory</a>: &#8220;<em>David Pescovitz</em>:
The Onion brilliantly parodies <a href="http://www.newyorker.com/fact/content/articles/050530fa_fact">Intelligent Design</a> believers:</p>

<blockquote>KANSAS CITY, KS—As the debate over the teaching of evolution in public schools continues, a new controversy over the science curriculum arose Monday in this embattled Midwestern state. Scientists from the Evangelical Center For Faith-Based Reasoning are now asserting that the long-held &#8216;theory of gravity&#8217; is flawed, and they have responded to it with a new theory of Intelligent Falling.

&#8216;Things fall not because they are acted upon by some gravitational force, but because a higher intelligence, &#8216;God&#8217; if you will, is pushing them down,&#8217; said Gabriel Burdett, who holds degrees in education, applied Scripture, and physics from Oral Roberts University&#8230;

Some evangelical physicists propose that Intelligent Falling provides an elegant solution to the central problem of modern physics.

&#8216;Anti-falling physicists have been theorizing for decades about the &#8216;electromagnetic force,&#8217; the &#8216;weak nuclear force,&#8217; the &#8216;strong nuclear force,&#8217; and so-called &#8216;force of gravity,&#8221; Burdett said. &#8216;And they tilt their findings toward trying to unite them into one force. But readers of the Bible have already known for millennia what this one, unified force is: His name is Jesus.&#8217;</blockquote>

        <h1>Inflorescence architecture</h1><div><p>Mating by outcrossing plants depends on the frequency and quality of interaction between pollen vectors and individual flowers.  However, the historical focus of pollination biology on individual flowers (floricentrism) cannot produce a complete understanding of the role of pollination in plant mating, because mating is an aggregate process, which depends on the reproductive outcomes of all of a plant&#8217;s flowers.  Simultaneous display of multiple flowers in an inflorescence increases a plant&#8217;s attractiveness to pollinators, which should generally enhance mating opportunities.  However, whenever pollinators visit multiple flowers on an inflorescence, self-pollination among flowers can reduce the pollen available for export to other plants (pollen discounting) and increase the incidence of inbreeding depression for embryos and offspring.  Therefore, the size of floral displays that maximizes mating frequency and quality generally balances the benefits of attractiveness against the costs of self-pollination.  This balance can shift considerably if different flowers serve female and male functions at one time (sexual segregation) and flowers are arranged in inflorescences so that pollinators visit female flowers before male flowers.  However, the effectiveness of sexual segregation depends on the extent to which a particular inflorescence architecture induces consistent movement patterns by pollinators.  In general, the consistency of pollinator movement patterns varies with inflorescence architecture and differs between pollinator types.  Such variation creates many options for the evolution of the diverse inflorescence characteristics within angiosperms, which can be appreciated only by moving beyond a floricentric perspective of the role of pollination in plant mating.</p>

        <h1>Trade-offs between clonal &amp; sexual reproduction</h1><div><p>Clonality is very common in flowering plants, but its consequences for sexual reproduction have rarely been explored. While clonal growth can increase the number of flowers a plant produces it may also limit reproductive success through pollen discounting (reduction in pollen exported to adjacent clones) and pollen limitation (failure of outside pollen to reach the centre of a clone). Using clones of domestic apple (<span class="SpeciesName">Malus x domestica</span>) that ranged from 1 to 5 orchard rows wide, we found that the patterns of siring success were consistent with the presence of pollen discounting, but we failed to detect evidence for pollen limitation. The results suggest that paternal function may be more sensitive to the effects of clonality than female function.</p>

        <h1>Temporal separation of gender</h1><div><p>Dichogamy, the temporal separation of gender within a flower, is widespread throughout the angiosperms, occurring in over 250 families. There are two forms of dichogamy: protandry, in which male function precedes female function, and protogyny, the converse. Dichogamy has traditionally been interpreted as a mechanism to avoid inbreeding. However, recent evidence indicates that this inbreeding-avoidance hypothesis cannot completely explain the evolution of dichogamy. An alternate hypothesis is that dichogamy acts to reduce interference between gender functions. Interference can occur within a flower or between flowers on an inflorescence and result in substantial reductions in male and female reproductive success. To date there are very few tests of this interference-avoidance hypothesis or, in fact, investigations of the evolution of dichogamy in general. My Ph.D. thesis was a comprehensive evaluation of the evolutionary significance of dichogamy, including functional, genetic, comparative, and theoretical analyses of this important floral character.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/mroutley/83193561/" title="Photo Sharing"><img src="http://farm1.static.flickr.com/37/83193561_cd01334e47_o.jpg" width="250" height="331" alt="clint"/></a></p>

<p>This <span class="SpeciesName">Claytonia</span> species is protandrous. The flower on the left is in male phase with its anthers shedding pollen and the stigma closed and unreceptive. The flower on the right is approximately one day older and is in female phase. The stigma is open and receptive and the anthers have moved away to the side and are empty of pollen.</p>

<h2>Functional analyses</h2>

<p>As an evaluation of the fitness consequences of protandry, we tested the interference-avoidance hypothesis with enclosed, artificial populations of <span class="SpeciesName">Chamerion angustifolium</span> (Onagraceae) by experimentally manipulating protandry and inflorescence size and measuring pollinator visitation, seed set, female outcrossing-rate, and outcross siring-success. Protandrous plants had a marginally higher female outcrossing rate than adichogamous plants, but similar seed set and visitation rates. More importantly, protandrous plants (blue points) had, on average, a twofold siring advantage relative to adichogamous plants (red points). However, this siring advantage did not increase linearly with inflorescence size, suggesting that protandry acts to enhance siring success, but not exclusively by reducing between-flower interference.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/mroutley/83194188/" title="Photo Sharing"><img src="http://farm1.static.flickr.com/43/83194188_e2c75e44c8.jpg" width="500" height="458" alt="siring"/></a></p>

<p>To better understand the function of protandry, we analyzed single bee visits to pairs of <span class="SpeciesName">C. angustifolium</span> flowers in the field and the lab. The patterns of pollen removal and deposition revealed two major consequences of simultaneous hermaphroditism. First, the presence of anthers impeded pollinator’s access to the stigma. Second, pollinators spent more time foraging on hermaphroditic flowers, relative to female flowers. Protandry allows pollen to be exported in the absence of this within-flower interference and can enhance both male and female reproductive success through reductions in pollen discounting and facilitated selfing, respectively.</p>

<h2>Genetic analysis</h2>

<p>The genetic basis of dichogamy may have important implications for its evolution. Consequently, we conducted genetic analyses of protandry in <span class="SpeciesName">C. angustifolium</span> using a paternal half-sib design and an artificial selection experiment. We found moderate heritability (h^2^=0.27) for the duration of male phase. An analysis of plants from the artificial selection experiment showed no genetic correlation between male-phase duration and aspects of floral size. However, we estimated a positive genetic correlation between male-phase duration and floral display size. In addition, we detected a negative correlation between male- and female-phase durations which creates the opportunity for fitness trade-offs between male and female function.</p>

<h2>Phylogenetic analysis</h2>

<p>To gain a broader perspective on the evolution of dichogamy, we used a current, well resolved phylogeny of the angiosperms to conduct a comparative analysis of dichogamy and self-incompatibility. Using paired-comparisons and maximum-likelihood correlation analyses, we found that protandry is positively correlated with self-incompatibility and protogyny with self-compatibility. These results support a role for interference avoidance in the evolution of protandry and inbreeding avoidance in the evolution of protogyny, suggesting that the two forms of dichogamy provide different functions. In addition, dichogamy changes character states throughout the phylogeny, allowing rapid responses to changing ecological circumstance.</p>

<h2>Theoretical analysis</h2>

<p>We developed a conceptual model to synthesize the effects of male-phase duration, inflorescence size, and inbreeding depression on pollen import and export. The relative fitness of protandry is strongly affected by the combination of floral display size and inbreeding depression. Furthermore, the trade-off between male- and female-phase durations produced a fitness landscape much more favourable to the evolution of protandry.</p>

<h2>Conclusions</h2>

<p>Collectively, this research suggest that protandry enhances male fitness through reductions in both within- and between-flower interference, while protogyny reduces inbreeding. This work has revealed unexpected fitness benefits to protandry and helps to explain the wide taxonomic and ecological distribution of this trait in flowering plants.</p>

        <h1>Population size</h1><div><p>The outcrossing rate is a fundamental attribute of plant populations that determines population genetic structure, individual plant fitness, and ultimately speciation rates. The outcrossing rate can be influenced by population size through reductions in both mate availability and pollinator service. We investigated the effect of population size on the outcrossing rate in 10 populations of <span class="SpeciesName">Aquilegia canadensis</span> in Southern Ontario, Canada.</p>

<p>Across a range of sizes from 32 to 750 reproductive individuals, we found that small populations (n &lt; 35, red line) had a significantly lower outcrossing rate than large populations (n &gt; 90, blue line).</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/mroutley/83193563/" title="Photo Sharing"><img src="http://farm1.static.flickr.com/38/83193563_089418aad7_o.png" width="373" height="360" alt="nXt"/></a></p>

<p>Given the high estimate for inbreeding depression in this species (0.88 ± 0.14), small populations may experience a rapid decline in population-level fitness that can lead to local extirpation. The consequences of human-induced habitat fragmentation suggest that such local extinctions are common due to this demographic effect.</p>
