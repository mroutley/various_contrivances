        <div class="quote">&ldquo;How in the world did we get to the point that filling out the long form census is just too much to ask?  I frankly cannot remember if I, personally,  have ever had to do the long form.  I’m old enough that I probably did and I hate forms enough that I may have blocked it from memory – but it simply cannot be too great a price to pay for being a Canadian citizen and helping to ensure that all citizens share in its benefits.  And my guess – the majority of Canadians would agree,  even if, like me, they hate the questions.&rdquo;</div><div>&mdash; <a href="http://afhimelfarb.wordpress.com/2010/07/16/bargain-basement-citizenship/">Bargain Basement Citizenship «&#160;Alex&#8217;s Blog</a></div>

Any thought that something like this might cause the Harper government to reconsider is, of course, risible. These honourable men rebuff their own high court verdicts. They rebuff the will of Parliament – when not shutting it down – on Afghan detainee documents. For them, international law is of trifling concern.&rdquo;</div><div>&mdash; <a href="http://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/opinions/in-the-matter-of-omar-khadr-shame-on-us/article1640305/">In the matter of Omar Khadr, shame on us - The Globe and Mail</a></div>
