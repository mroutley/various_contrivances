        <h1>Stern Review on the economics of climate change</h1><div><p>The Stern Review has been in the news recently for predicting that global warming could cost up to $7 trillion if not addressed soon. Of course, this has caused quite a stir as it offsets many of the, likely unfounded, concerns that fixing climate change will cost too much. The <a href="http://www.hm-treasury.gov.uk/independent_reviews/stern_review_economics_climate_change/stern_review_report.cfm">full report</a> is available online and should be a quite interesting, if long, read.</p></div>

        <h1>Climate change and public relations</h1><div><p><a href="http://environment.guardian.co.uk/climatechange/story/0,,1875762,00.html">This article</a> in the Guardian explores the use of public relations firms by big oil companies to fight against the science of climate change. Apparently, the same tactics and people even of the tobacco industry&#8217;s fight against the link between smoking and cancer are being employed by the oil industry.</p></div>
