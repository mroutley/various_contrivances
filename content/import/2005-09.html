        <h1>Intelligent design in the classroom</h1><div><p>Now that intelligent design is back in the Canadian news, we should consider (again!) the consequences of teaching intelligent design in the classroom.</p>

<p>Intelligent design makes two postulates:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Complexity cannot be explained by science.</p></li>
<li><p>Given 1, complexity comes from an intelligent designer.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Now, consider a science exam in any subject and the danger of intelligent design being taught in school becomes apparent.</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Physics question: Why does the earth orbit the sun?</p>

<p>ID answer: Because of the unnamed intelligence.</p>

<p>Science answer: General relativity.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Geology question: What creates mountains?</p>

<p>ID answer: The unnamed intelligence.</p>

<p>Science answer: Plate tectonics</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Biology question: Why are all species on Earth connected through common descent?</p>

<p>ID answer: The unnamed intelligence did it.</p>

<p>Science answer: Evolution.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Don&#8217;t be fooled that the creationist agenda ends with biology. They intend to reduce science education to: That&#8217;s really complicated; God did it.</p></div>
