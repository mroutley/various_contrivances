I enjoy solving complex problems with innovative research, sophisticated analysis, and compelling storytelling.

So far, I've been fortunate to follow my curiousity into a variety of fields:

* As an academic in [evolutionary ecology](https://www.slideshare.net/slideshow/embed_code/key/NenzTBMBt6cPIP)
* Running my own statistical consulting business
* Contributing to Ontario's infrastructure planning and policy at [Treasury Board Secretariat](https://www.ontario.ca/page/treasury-board-secretariat)
* Leading analytics teams at both Treasury Board Secretarit and the Ministry of Infrastrucutre
* Leading a team of economists and transportation planners in providing and using a comprehensive evidence base for Metrolinx's [project evaluations](http://www.metrolinx.com/en/regionalplanning/projectevaluation/benefitscases/benefits_case_analyses.aspx)
* Co-founding [PsephoAnalytics](http://www.psephoanalytics.ca/) to model voting behaviour in order to accurately explain political campaigns
