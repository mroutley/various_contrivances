<p>Since I&#8217;m looking for work, I found <a href="http://dev2dev.bea.com/blog/simonvc/archive/2006/11/sorting_candida.html">this post</a> rather interesting. They&#8217;ve applied a spam filter to resumes to automatically filter through candidates. The output is only as good as the reference resumes used to construct the filter, but still an intriguing idea. My results are below. Most importantly the probability of me not being hired is 1.15e-59, which is a very, very small number. Perhaps I should add this fact to my resume?</p>
