<p>A recent press release from the federal government entitled &#8220;<a href="http://news.gc.ca/web/view/en/index.jsp?articleid=323199">Making a Strong Canadian Economy Even Stronger</a>&#8221; contains a sentence that struck me as odd.</p>

<blockquote>As a result of actions taken in Budget 2007, Canada&#8217;s marginal effective tax rate (METR) on new business investment improved from third-highest in the G7 to third-lowest by 2011.</blockquote>

<p>Fair enough, tax rates are projected to decline. But notice how they phrase the context of this reduction. Moving from third highest to third lowest is, in a list of seven countries, a change from third to fifth. Not a dramatic change &#8212; we were near the middle and we still are.</p>
