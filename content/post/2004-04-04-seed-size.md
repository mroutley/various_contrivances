<p>I have been investigating issues of ovule and seed development recently. One question that has come up is: How much variation is there in seed size? I had analysed some seed set data for some <a href="http://pmbrowser.info/pmdisplay.cgi?issn=00143820&amp;uids=12683521">earlier work</a> with some image analysis software. Consequently I have a large data set of seed area and perimeter for <span class="SpeciesName">Chamerion angustifolium</span>. A rough look at the data is:</p>

<p>The data set is available as <a href="http://public.me.com/mroutley/">seedSizeData.txt.zip</a>. Bewarned, the file contains over 100,000 lines &#8212; be sure to use an efficient text editor or stats package. All dimensions are in cm. The seed? column contains a 1 for seeds and 2 for objects smaller than seeds. See <a href="http://pmbrowser.info/pmdisplay.cgi?issn=00143820&amp;uids=12683521">this</a> for details.</p>
