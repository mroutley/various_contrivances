<p>An interesting read from <a href="http://www.wired.com/">Wired News</a> &#8212; <a href="http://www.wired.com/news/wiredmag/1,2167,65111,00.html">The Crusade Against Evolution</a>. In addition, the <a href="http://www.pandasthumb.org/">Panda&#8217;s thumb</a> has been following and carefully dissecting the recent controversy over an intelligent design paper being published in a peer-reviewed journal.

The debate is important and the intelligent design supporters have to be countered, but their arguments have become hackneyed.</p>
