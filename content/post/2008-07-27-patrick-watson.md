<p>Reading up on the upcoming <a href="http://www.polarismusicprize.ca/">Polaris Music Prize</a> reminded me of Patrick Watson, last year&#8217;s winner of the prize. His &#8220;Close to Paradise&#8221; album is inventive with intriguing lyrics, unique sounds, and an often driving piano track. Particular stand out tracks are <a href="http://phobos.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewAlbum?i=187018157&amp;id=187017583&amp;s=143455">Luscious Life</a>, <a href="http://phobos.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewAlbum?i=187018250&amp;id=187017583&amp;s=143455">Drifters</a>, and <a href="http://phobos.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewAlbum?i=187018471&amp;id=187017583&amp;s=143455">The Great Escape</a>. The album is well worth considering and I&#8217;m looking forward to listening to the short-listed artists for this year&#8217;s prize.</p>
