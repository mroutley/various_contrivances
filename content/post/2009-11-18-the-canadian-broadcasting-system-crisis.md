> The Canadian TV industry isn't naturally an economically viable ecosystem where each player can succeed on its own and still fulfill a cultural responsibility. It never has been and it may never be in the future. When models break - as they are now - the answer isn't simply to drain money from one sector of the ecosystem and pump it into another. That's a last-ditch &#8220;life support&#8221; approach, not one that promotes a sustainable future. It's a band-aid on a much bigger problem and the answer to such extreme problems always lies in taking radical and decisive action, not applying first-aid to slow the bleeding while hoping that the problem will heal itself.
