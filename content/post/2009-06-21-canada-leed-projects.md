The <a href="http://www.cagbc.org/">CaGBC</a> maintains a list of all the <a href="http://www.cagbc.org/leed/leed_projects/index.php">registered LEED projects</a> in Canada. This is a great resource, but rather awkward for analyses. I've copied these data into a <a href="http://dabbledb.com/">DabbleDB</a> application with some of the maps and tabulations that I frequently need to reference.

<a href="http://mroutley.dabbledb.com/publish/leedcanada/0b6098d1-5901-4f05-962d-f06eaeec0d57/mapofallleedprojects.html">Here</a> for example is a map of the density of LEED projects in each province. While <a href="http://mroutley.dabbledb.com/publish/leedcanada/9660a615-7f1d-4419-bf54-2792562803ee/provincexlevelxtype.html">here</a> is a rather detailed view of the kinds of projects across provinces. There are several other views <a href="http://mroutley.dabbledb.com/publish/leedcanada">available</a>. Are there any others that might be useful?
