<p><a href="http://1">Sean Rice&#8217;s</a> <a href="http://2">Evolutionary Theory</a> is an excellent journey through the mathematical foundations of evolutionary biology. The book covers a wide array of theory, including single locus models, drift, Price&#8217;s Theorem, game theory, and multilevel selection. Despite the often intense content, the book is written with a great, economical style that is easy to read. More importantly, the consistent presentation of such a broad collection of theory highlights the unifying principles of evolution.</p>

<p>This book serves as a great primer on evolutionary theory and, no doubt, I will be refering to it often as a reference text. Evolutionary biology has benefited greatly from a strong theoretical basis. Rice&#8217;s book continues that tradition.</p>
