I'm not sure how this escaped my notice until now, but `RSiteSearch` is a very useful command in <a href="http://www.r-project.org">R</a>. Passing a string to this function loads up your web browser with search results from the R documentation and mailing list. So, for example:

`RSiteSearch("glm")`


will show you everything you need to know about using R for generalised linear models.
