<p>The <a href="http://www.cbc.ca">CBC</a> has begun an experiment with <a href="http://www.cbc.ca/podcasting">podcasting</a>. I&#8217;m impressed with the progressive approach to technology that the <a href="http://www.cbc.ca">CBC</a> has adopted and hope they expand the experiment to more of their programs.</p>

<p>This has the added effect of making my <a href="http://www.cbc.ca/quirks/">Quirks &amp; Quarks</a> download <a href="http://matt.routleynet.org/post/81987068/quirks-quarks">script</a> obsolete.</p>
