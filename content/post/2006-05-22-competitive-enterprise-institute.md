<p>The Competitive Enterprise Institute has put out some <a href="http://streams.cei.org/">ads</a> that would be quite funny if they weren&#8217;t so <a href="https://cf.iats.missouri.edu/news/NewsBureauSingleNews.cfm?newsid=9842">misleading</a>. I imagine that most viewers can see through the propaganda of the oil industry. Regardless, in the long-term, industries that invest in efficient and low-polluting technology will <a href="http://wired.com/wired/archive/14.05/green.html">win</a> and the members of CEI will be out of business.</p>
