<p>In collaboration with <a href="http://homepages.ucalgary.ca/~jvamosi/">Jana</a> and <a href="http://www.bio.ucalgary.ca/divisions/ecology/vamosi.html">Steve</a> Vamosi, I have started a new project called Plantae. The goal of this project is to create a community website for the collection of evolutionary and ecological data for plant species. An early prototype of the project is <a href="http://plantae.info">available</a> and we welcome feedback on all aspects of the project.</p>

<p>Although the current implementation is rather rough. I hope to make some rapid progress on the design and function of the site in the new year.</p>

<p>Update: plantae has a new home at <a href="http://plantae.info">plantae.info</a>.</p>
