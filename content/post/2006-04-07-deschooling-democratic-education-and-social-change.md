<p>Matt Hern provides an <a href="http://canadianvoices.org/speakers.php?id=19">interesting podcast</a> available from <a href="http://canadianvoices.org/">Canadian Voices</a>. He considers the 150 year history of compulsory state education and asks what benefits it has provided. The basic question is, Why do we send our kids to school? Although the answer seems obvious, he takes a different approach and argues for alternatives to public education. I’m always fascinated when someone argues against what I believe to be obvious. That’s when I learn the most about my biases.</p>
