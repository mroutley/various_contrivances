I'm certain that paying attention to where my food comes from is important. Food production influences my health, has environmental consequences, and affects both urban and rural design. Ideally, I would develop relationships with local farmers, carefully choose organic produce, and always consider broad environmental impacts. Except, I like to spend time with my young family, try to get some exercise, and have more than enough commitments through work to actually spend this much effort on food choices. So, I've outsourced this process to the excellent <a href="http://www.mamaearth.ca/">Mama Earth Organics</a>.

Every week a basket of fresh organic and/or local fruit and vegetables arrives on our doorstep. Part of the fun of this service is that different items arrive each week, which diversifies our weekly food routine. But, we always know what's coming several days in advance, so we can plan our meals well ahead of time. After over a year of service, we've only had a single complaint about quality and this was handled very quickly by Mama Earth with a full refund plus credit.

We've found the small basket is sufficient for two adults and a picky four-year old. We've also added in some fresh bread from St. John's Bakery, which has been consistently delicious and lasts through most of the week.
