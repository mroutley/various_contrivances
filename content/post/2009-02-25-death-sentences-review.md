Sentences</a>
by Don Watson is a wonderful book &#8212; simultaneously funny, scary, and
inspiring &#8212; that describes how &#8220;clich√©s, weasel words, and
management-speak&#8221; are infecting public language.</p>

<p>The humour comes from Watson&#8217;s acerbic commentary and fantastic scorn
for phrases like:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Given the within year and budget time flexibility accorded to the
  science agencies in the determination of resource allocation from
  within their global budget, a multi-parameter approach to
  maintaining the agencies budgets in real terms is not appropriate.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The book is scary because it makes a strong argument for the dangers
of this type of language.  Citizens become confused and disinterested,
customers become jaded, and people loose their love for language.
Also, as a public servant I see this kind of language every day and
often find myself struggling to avoid banality and cliches (not to
mention bullet points).  We need more forceful advocates like Don
Watson to call out politicians and corporations for abusing our
language.  This book certainly makes me want to try harder.  And
what&#8217;s more inspiring than struggling for a good cause against long
odds?</p>

<p>The book also has a great glossary of typical weasel words with possible synonyms. So, I&#8217;m keeping the book in my office for quick reference.</p>
