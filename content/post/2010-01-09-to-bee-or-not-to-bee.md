<a class="link" href="http://www.cbc.ca/documentaries/natureofthings/2010/bees/">To Bee or Not to Bee: The Nature of Things</a></p> <div><p>An interesting discussion of bees with excellent footage. The documentary makes a good case for the importance of bees and describes the many challenges they face.

Fun to see some old colleagues too.
