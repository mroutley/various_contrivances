<p>Prior to general release, <a href="http://plantae.info">plantae</a> is moving web hosts. This seems like a good time to point out that all of plantae&#8217;s code is hosted at <a href="http://code.google.com/p/plantae/">Google Code</a>. The project has great potential and deserves consistent attention. Unfortunately, I can&#8217;t continue to develop the code. So, if you have an interest in collaborative software, particularly in the scientific context, I encourage you to <a href="http://code.google.com/p/plantae/">take a look</a>.</p>
