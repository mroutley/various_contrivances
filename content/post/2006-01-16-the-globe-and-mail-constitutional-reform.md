<blockquote>
  <p>The Constitution of Canada guarantees its people important rights, such as freedom of religion, freedom of expression, fair trials, free elections, and language rights. But the effective exercise of these rights is impossible without safe water to drink, wholesome food to eat, and clean air to breathe. The right to a clean and healthy environment – arguably the most fundamental right of all – is conspicuously absent from our Charter of Rights and Freedoms, despite being a feature of the constitutions of many other nations.</p>
