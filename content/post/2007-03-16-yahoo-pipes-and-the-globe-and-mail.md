<p>Most of my updates arrive through <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_feed">feeds</a> to <a href="http://www.newsgator.com/NGOLProduct.aspx?ProdID=NetNewsWire">NetNewsWire</a>. Since my main source of national news and analysis is the <a href="http://www.theglobeandmail.com/">Globe and Mail</a>, I&#8217;m quite happy that they provide <a href="http://www.theglobeandmail.com/rss/">many feeds</a> for accessing their content. The problem is that many news stories are duplicated across these feeds. Furthermore, tracking all of the feeds of interest is challenging.</p>

<p>The new <a href="http://pipes.yahoo.com/">Yahoo Pipes</a> offer a solution to these problems. Without providing too much detail, pipes are a way to filter, connect, and generally mash-up the web with a straightforward interface. I&#8217;ve used this service to collect all of the Globe and Mail feeds of interest, filter out the duplicates, and produce a feed I can subscribe to. Nothing fancy, but quite useful. <a href="http://pipes.yahoo.com/pipes/pipe.info?_id=YjZyKsHM2xGr3_z5l7okhQ">The pipe</a> is publicly available and if you don&#8217;t agree with my choice of news feeds, you are free to clone mine and create your own. There are plenty of other pipes available, so take a look to see if anything looks useful to you. Even better, create your own.</p>

<p>If you really want those details, Tim O&#8217;Reilly <a href="http://radar.oreilly.com/archives/2007/02/pipes_and_filte.html">has plenty</a>.</p>
