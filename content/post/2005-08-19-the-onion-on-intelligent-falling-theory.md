<a href="http://www.boingboing.net/2005/08/18/the_onion_on_intelli.html">The Onion on Intelligent Falling theory</a>: &#8220;<em>David Pescovitz</em>:
The Onion brilliantly parodies <a href="http://www.newyorker.com/fact/content/articles/050530fa_fact">Intelligent Design</a> believers:</p>

<blockquote>KANSAS CITY, KSâ€”As the debate over the teaching of evolution in public schools continues, a new controversy over the science curriculum arose Monday in this embattled Midwestern state. Scientists from the Evangelical Center For Faith-Based Reasoning are now asserting that the long-held &#8216;theory of gravity&#8217; is flawed, and they have responded to it with a new theory of Intelligent Falling.

&#8216;Things fall not because they are acted upon by some gravitational force, but because a higher intelligence, &#8216;God&#8217; if you will, is pushing them down,&#8217; said Gabriel Burdett, who holds degrees in education, applied Scripture, and physics from Oral Roberts University&#8230;

Some evangelical physicists propose that Intelligent Falling provides an elegant solution to the central problem of modern physics.

&#8216;Anti-falling physicists have been theorizing for decades about the &#8216;electromagnetic force,&#8217; the &#8216;weak nuclear force,&#8217; the &#8216;strong nuclear force,&#8217; and so-called &#8216;force of gravity,&#8221; Burdett said. &#8216;And they tilt their findings toward trying to unite them into one force. But readers of the Bible have already known for millennia what this one, unified force is: His name is Jesus.&#8217;</blockquote>
