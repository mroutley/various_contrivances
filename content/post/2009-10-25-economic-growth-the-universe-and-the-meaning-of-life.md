> 200 years ago, economists made a prediction, and we got it wrong. &#8220;Big deal&#8221; you might say. But it was a big deal; a much bigger deal than some piddling mistake like failing to predict a global financial crisis. Basically, 200 years ago economists predicted that long run growth was impossible. That&#8217;s the biggest thing in economics you can be wrong about.
