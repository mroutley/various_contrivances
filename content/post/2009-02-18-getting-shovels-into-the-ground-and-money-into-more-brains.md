> The first rule of reading a federal budget is this: When a round number such as $1-billion appears, it means the government (a) picked the number from the air, (b) doesn&#8217;t know how or where the money will be spent, or (c) doesn&#8217;t have a process for making that decision. A round number, especially a big one, means the government is flying blind.
