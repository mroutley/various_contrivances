<p>Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. gave a speech at the Sierra Club&#8217;s National Convention and Expo on September 10, 2005 in San Francisco. <a href="http://1">The transcript is available</a> and I recommend it highly. He describes the relations among business, politics, and the environment; making a strong case for the importance of free-markets and democracy to environmental protection.</p>
