<a href="http://www.instapaper.com/iphone">Instapaper</a> is an integral part of my web-reading routine. Typically, I have a few minutes early in the morning and scattered throughout the day for quick scans of my favourite web sites and news feeds. I capture anything worth reading with Instapaper's bookmarklet to create a reading queue of interesting articles. Then with a quick update to the <a href="http://www.instapaper.com/iphone">iPhone app</a> this queue is available whenever I find longer blocks of time for reading, particularly during the morning subway ride to work or late at night.

I also greatly appreciate Instapaper's text view, which removes all the banners, ads, and link lists from the articles to present a nice and clean text view of the content only. I often find myself saving an article to Instapaper even when I have the time to read it, just so I can use this text-only view.

Instapaper is one of my favourite tools and the first iPhone application I purchased.
