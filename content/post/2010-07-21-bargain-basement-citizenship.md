> How in the world did we get to the point that filling out the long form census is just too much to ask?  I frankly cannot remember if I, personally,  have ever had to do the long form.  I’m old enough that I probably did and I hate forms enough that I may have blocked it from memory – but it simply cannot be too great a price to pay for being a Canadian citizen and helping to ensure that all citizens share in its benefits.  And my guess – the majority of Canadians would agree,  even if, like me, they hate the questions.
