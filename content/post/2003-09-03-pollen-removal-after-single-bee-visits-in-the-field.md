<ul>
<li>These data are pollen counts from anthers before and after single bee visits in populations of <span class="SpeciesName">Chamerion angustifolium</span> from Montana. Pollen was quantified with a Beckman-Coulter Multisizer 3 particle counter.</li>
</ul>
<p>Format:</p>

<ul>
<li>Population: The population sampled, either tetraploid or diploid.</li>
<li>Sample: An identification code representing the plant and flower sampled.</li>
<li>StigmaPresence: Some flowers had their stigma and style removed with forceps. Others were left intact.</li>
<li>Visitation: Whether the anther was sampled before or after a single bee visit.</li>
<li>PollenCount: The estimated amount of pollen present in the flower.</li>
