We've [gathered up](http://www.psephoanalytics.ca/2014/09/toronto-election-data.html) the mayoral-race results from Toronto and converted them into a data package for R called [toVotes](https://github.com/Psepho/toVotes/). Hopefully this will be a useful resource for anyone interested in election modelling.
