<p>Sun’s new <a href="http://www.network.com/">Grid Compute Utility</a> could be a great resource. As I described in an <a href="http://matt.routleynet.org/articles/2006/03/15/remote-data-analysis">earlier post</a>, running simulations can be a challenge with limited computer resources. Rather than waiting hours for my computers to work through thousands of iterations, I could pay Sun $1, which would likely be sufficient for the scale of my work. This would be well worth the investment! I spend a single dollar and quickly get the results I need for my research or clients.</p>

<p>Apparently, the American government has classified the Sun Grid as a weapon, so we can’t access it here in Canada, yet. I’m sure this will change shortly.</p>
