<p><a href="http://calendar.google.com">Google Calendar</a> has been featured in the news recently, and for good reason. Many of us have wanted access to a good online calendar program. One of my favourite features of Google Calendar is its integration with <a href="http://mail.google.com">Gmail</a>. If Gmail detects an event in your email message, a link appears that sends the information to Google Calendar. This is incredibly convenient and, seems to me, is one of the great promises of computers: reducing the tedious work that occupies much of our day.</p>
